Chapter 21
HIS NAME IS Robert Paulson and he is forty-eight years old. His name is
Robert Paulson, and Robert Paulson will be forty-eight years old, forever.
On a long enough time line, everyone's survival rate drops to zero.
Big Bob.
The big cheesebread. The big moosie was on a regulation chill-and-drill
homework assignment. This was how Tyler got into my condominium to
blow it up with homemade dynamite. You take a spray canister of
refrigerant, R-12 if you can still get it, what with the ozone hole and
everything, or R-134a, and you spray it into the lock cylinder until the
works are frozen.
On a chill-and-drill assignment, you spray the lock on a pay telephone or a
parking meter or a newspaper box. Then you use a hammer and a cold
chisel to shatter the frozen lock cylinder.
On a regulation drill-and-fill homework assignment, you drill the phone or
the automatic bank teller machine, then you screw a lube fitting into the
hole and use a grease gun to pump your target full of axle grease or vanilla
pudding or plastic cement.
It's not that Project Mayhem needed to steal a handful of change. The
Paper Street Soap Company was backlogged on filling orders. God help us
when the holidays came around. Homework is to build your nerve. You
need some cunning. Build your investment in Project Mayhem.
Instead of a cold chisel, you can use an electric drill on the frozen lock
cylinder. This works just as well and it's more quiet.
It was a cordless electric drill that the police thought was a gun when they
blew Big Bob away.
There was nothing to tie Big Bob to Project Mayhem or fight club or the
soap.
In his pocket was a wallet photo of himself huge and naked at first glance
in a posing strap at some contest. It's a stupid way to live, Bob said. You're
blind from the stage lights, and deaf from the feedback rush of the sound
system until the judge will order, extend your right quad, flex and hold.
Put your hands where we can see them.
Extend your left arm, flex the bicep and hold.
