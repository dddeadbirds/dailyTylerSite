Yeah. Well. Whatever. You can't teach God anything.
God asks me what I remember.
I remember everything.
The bullet out of Tyler's gun, it tore out my other cheek to give me a
jagged smile from ear to ear. Yeah, just like an angry Halloween pumpkin.
Japanese demon. Dragon of Avarice.
Marla's still on Earth, and she writes to me. Someday, she says, they'll
bring me back.
And if there were a telephone in Heaven, I would call Marla from Heaven
and the moment she says, "Hello," I wouldn't hang up. I'd say, "Hi. What's
happening? Tell me every little thing."
But I don't want to go back. Not yet.
Just because.
Because every once in a while, somebody brings me my lunch tray and my
meds and he has a black eye or his forehead is swollen with stitches, and
he says:
"We miss you Mr. Durden."
Or somebody with a broken nose pushes a mop past me and whispers:
"Everything's going according to the plan.
Whispers
"We're going to break up civilization so we can make something better out
of the world."
Whispers
"We look forward to getting you back."
