can topple any building in the world. You have to tamp it good and tight
with sandbags so the blast goes against the column and not out into the

This how-to stuff isn't in any history book.
The three ways to make napalm: One, you can mix equal parts of gasoline
and frozen orange juice concentrate. Two, you can mix equal parts of
gasoline and diet cola. Three, you can dissolve crumbled cat litter in
gasoline until the mixture is thick.
Ask me how to make nerve gas. Oh, all those crazy car bombs.
Nine minutes.
The Parker-Morris Building will go over, all one hundred and ninety-one
floors, slow as a tree falling in the forest. Timber. You can topple

Tyler and meat the edge of the roof, the gun in my mouth, I'm wondering

Eight minutes.
Then the smoke, smoke starts out of the broken windows. The demolition
team will hit the primary charge in maybe eight minutes. The primary
charge will blow the base charge, the foundation columns will crumble,
and the photo series of the Parker-Morris Building will go into all the
history books.
The five-picture time-lapse series. Here, the building's standing. Second
picture, the building will be at an eighty-degree angle. Then a seventydegree angle. The building's at a forty-five-degree angle in the fourth
picture when the skeleton starts to give and the tower gets a slight arch to
it. The last shot, the tower, all one hundred and ninety-one floors, will
slam down on the national museum which is Tyler's real target.
"This is our world, now, our world," Tyler says, "and those ancient people
are dead."
