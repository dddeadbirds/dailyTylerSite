Where are we going?
What is there to look forward to?
On Paper Street, Marla and I walk through the garden at night with our
bare feet, every step brushing up the smell of sage and lemon verbena and
rose geranium. Black shirts and black pants hunch around us with candles,
lifting plant leaves to kill a snail or slug. Marla asks, what's going on here?
Tufts of hair surface beside the dirt clods. Hair and shit. Bone meal and
blood meal. The plants are growing faster than the space monkeys can cut
them back.
Marla asks, "What are you going to do?"
What's the word?
In the dirt is a shining spot of gold, and I kneel down to see. What's going
to happen next, I don't know, I tell Marla.
It looks like we've both been dumped.
In the corner of my eye, the space monkeys pace around in black, each one
hunched over his candle. The little spot of gold in the dirt is a molar with a
gold filling. Next to it surface two more molars with silver amalgam
fillings. It's a jawbone.
I say, no, I can't say what's going to happen. And I push the one, two, three
molars into the dirt and hair and shit and bone and blood where Marla
won't see.
