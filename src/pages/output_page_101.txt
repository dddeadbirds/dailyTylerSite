something. As if the only choice they have left is how they're going to die
and they want to die in a fight.
They have to fight each other, these guys.
Nobody else will tag them for a fight, and they can't tag anybody except
another twitching skinny, all bones and rush, since nobody else will
register to fight them.
Guys watching don't even yell when guys like our mechanic go at each
other.
All you hear is the fighters breathing through their teeth, hands slapping
for a hold, the whistle and impact when fists hammer and hammer on thin
hollow ribs, point-blank in a clinch. You see tendons and muscle and veins
under the skin of these guys jump. Their skin shines, sweating, corded,
and wet under the one light.
Ten, fifteen minutes disappear. Their smell, they sweat and these guys'
smell, it reminds you of fried chicken.
Twenty minutes of fight club will go by. Finally, one guy will go down.
After a fight, two drug recovery guys will hang together for the rest of the
night, wasted and smiling from fighting so hard.
Since fight club, this mechanic guy is always hanging around the house on
Paper Street. Wants me to hear the song he wrote. Wants me to see the
birdhouse he built. The guy showed me a picture of some girl and asked
me if she was pretty enough to marry.
Sitting in the front seat of the Corniche, the guy says, "Did you see this
cake I made for you? I made this."
It's not my birthday. "Some oil was getting by the rings," the mechanic
guy says, "but 1 changed the oil and the air filter. I checked the valve lash
and the timing. It's supposed to rain, tonight, so I changed the blades."
I ask, what's Tyler been planning?
The mechanic opens the ashtray and pushes the cigarette lighter in. He
says, "Is this a test? Are you testing us?"
Where's Tyler?
"The first rule about fight club is you don't talk about fight club," the
mechanic says. "And the last rule about Project Mayhem is you don't ask
questions."
So what can he tell me?
