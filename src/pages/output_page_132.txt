A man is dead, I say. This game is over. It's not for fun anymore. Then,
from the darkness outside the crowd comes the anonymous voice of the
chapter leader: "The first rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight
club."
I yell, go home!
"The second rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club."
Fight club is canceled! Project Mayhem is canceled.
"The third rule is only two guys to a fight."
I am Tyler Durden, I yell. And I'm ordering you to get out!
And no one's looking at me. The men just stare at each other across the
center of the room.
The voice of the chapter leader goes slowly around the room. Two men to
a fight. No shirts. No shoes.
The fight goes on and on and on as long as it has to.
Picture this happening in a hundred cities, in a half-dozen languages.
The rules end, and I'm still standing in the center of the light.
"Registered fight number one, take the floor," yells the voice out of the
darkness. "Clear the center of the club."
I don't move.
"Clear the center of the club!"
I don't move.
The one light reflects out of the darkness in one hundred pairs of eyes, all
of them focused on me, waiting. I try to see each man the way Tyler
would see him. Choose the best fighters for training in Project Mayhem.
Which ones would Tyler invite to work at the Paper Street Soap
Company?
"Clear the center of the club!" This is established fight club procedure.
After three requests from the chapter leader, I will be ejected from the
club.
But I'm Tyler Durden. I invented fight club. Fight club is mine. I wrote
those rules. None of you would be here if it wasn't for me. And I say it
stops here!
"Prepare to evict the member in three, two, one."
