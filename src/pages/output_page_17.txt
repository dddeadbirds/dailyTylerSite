A single frame in a movie is on the screen for one-sixtieth of a second.
Divide a second into sixty equal parts. That's how long the erection is.
Towering four stories tall over the popcorn auditorium, slippery red and
terrible, and no one sees it.
You wake up at Logan, again.
This is a terrible way to travel. I go to meetings my boss doesn't want to
attend. I take notes. I'll get back to you.
Wherever I'm going, I'll be there to apply the formula. I'll keep the secret
intact.
It's simple arithmetic.
It's a story problem.
If a new car built by my company leaves Chicago traveling west at 60
miles per hour, and the rear differential locks up, and the car crashes and
burns with everyone trapped inside, does my company initiate a recall?
You take the population of vehicles in the field (A) and multiply it by the
probable rate of failure (B), then multiply the result by the average cost of
an out-of-court settlement (C).
A times B times C equals X. This is what it will cost if we don't initiate a
recall.
If X is greater than the cost of a recall, we recall the cars and no one gets
hurt.
If X is less than the cost of a recall, then we don't recall.
Everywhere I go, there's the burned-up wadded-up shell of a car waiting
for me. I know where all the skeletons are. Consider this my job security.
Hotel time, restaurant food. Everywhere I go, I make tiny friendships with
the people sitting beside me from Logan to Krissy to Willow Run.
What I am is a recall campaign coordinator, I tell the single-serving friend
sitting next to me, but I'm working toward a career as a dishwasher.
You wake up at O'Hare, again.
Tyler spliced a penis into everything after that. Usually, close-ups, or a
Grand Canyon vagina with an echo, four stories tall and twitching with
blood pressure as Cinderella danced with her Prince Charming and people
watched. Nobody complained. People ate and drank, but the evening
wasn't the same. People feel sick or start to cry and don't know why. Only
a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
