Chapter 6
ONE MORNING, THERE'S the dead jellyfish of a used condom floating
in the toilet.
This is how Tyler meets Marla.
I get up to take a leak, and there against the sort of cave paintings of dirt in
the toilet bowl is this. You have to wonder, what do sperm think.
This?
This is the vaginal vault?
What's happening here?
All night long, I dreamed I was humping Marla Singer. Marla Singer
smoking her cigarette. Marla Singer rolling her eyes. I wake up alone in
my own bed, and the door to Tyler's room is closed. The door to Tyler's
room is never closed. All night, it was raining. The shingles on the roof
blister, buckle, curl, and the rain comes through and collects on top of the
ceiling plaster and drips down through the light fixtures.
When it's raining, we have to pull the fuses. You don't dare turn on the
lights. The house that Tyler rents, it has three stories and a basement. We
carry around candles. It has pantries and screened sleeping porches and
stained-glass windows on the stairway landing. There are bay windows
with window seats in the parlor. The baseboard moldings are carved and
varnished and eighteen inches high.
The rain trickles down through the house, and everything wooden swells
and shrinks, and the nails in everything wooden, the floors and baseboards
and window casings, the nails inch out and rust.
Everywhere there are rusted nails to step on or snag your elbow on, and
there's only one bathroom for the seven bedrooms, and now there's a used
condom.
The house is waiting for something, a zoning change or a will to come out
of probate, and then it will be torn down. I asked Tyler how long he's been
here, and he said about six weeks. Before the dawn of time, there was an
owner who collected lifetime stacks of the National Geographic and
Reader's Digest. Big teetering stacks of magazines that get taller every
time it rains. Tyler says the last tenant used to fold the glossy magazine
