venison to dry in the empty car pool lane of an abandoned superhighway
stretching eight-lanes-wide and August-hot for a thousand miles."
This was the goal of Project Mayhem, Tyler said, the complete and
rightaway destruction of civilization.
What comes next in Project Mayhem, nobody except Tyler knows. The
second rule is you don't ask questions.
"Don't get any bullets," Tyler told the Assault Committee. "And just so
you don't worry about it, yes, you're going to have to kill someone.
Arson. Assault. Mischief and Misinformation.
No questions. No questions. No excuses and no lies.

Tyler wanted me to type up and copy. A week ago, Tyler was pacing out
the dimensions of the basement of the rented house on Paper Street. It's
sixty-five shoe lengths front to back and forty shoe lengths side to side.
Tyler was thinking out loud. Tyler asked me, "What is six times seven?"
Forty-two.
"And forty-two times three?"
One hundred and twenty-six.
Tyler gave me a handwritten list of notes and said to type it and make
seventy-two copies.
Why that many?
"Because," Tyler said, "that's how many guys can sleep in the basement, if
we put them in triple-decker army surplus bunk beds."
I asked, what about their stuff?
Tyler said, "They won't bring anything more than what's on the list, and it
should all fit under a mattress."
The list my boss finds in the copy machine, the copy machine counter still
set for seventy-two copies, the list says:
"Bringing the required items does not guarantee admission to training, but
no applicant will be considered unless he arrives equipped with the
following items and exactly five hundred dollars cash for personal burial
money."
" It costs at least three hundred dollars to cremate an indigent corpse,
Tyler told me, and the price was going up. Anyone who dies without at
least this much money, their body goes to an autopsy class.
