all day, and all day, teams of space monkeys are eating out of the plastic
bowls they brought with them.
One morning I'm leaving for work and Big Bob's on the front
porch wearing black shoes and a black shirt and pants. I ask, has he seen
Tyler lately? Did Tyler send him here?
"The first rule about Project Mayhem," Big Bob says with his heels
together and his back ramrod straight, "is you don't ask questions about
Project Mayhem."
So what brainless little honor has Tyler assigned him, I ask. There are
guys whose job is to just boil rice all day or washout eating bowls or clean
the crapper. All day. Has Tyler promised Big Bob enlightenment if he
spends sixteen hours a day wrapping bars of soap?
Big Bob doesn't say anything.
I go to work. I come home, and Big Bob's still on the porch. I don't sleep
all night, and the next morning, Big Bob's out tending the garden.
Before I leave for work, I ask Big Bob, who let him in? Who assigned him
this task? Did he see Tyler? Was Tyler here last night?
Big Bob says, "The first rule in Project Mayhem is you don't talk-"
I cut him off. I say, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And while I'm at work, teams of space monkeys dig up the muddy lawn
around the house and cut the dirt with Epsom salts to lower the acidity,
and spade in loads of free steer manure from the stockyards and bags of
hair clippings from barber shops to ward off moles and mice and boost the
protein in the soil.
At any time of the night, space monkeys from some slaughterhouse come
home with bags of blood meal to boost the iron in the soil and bone meal
to boost the phosphorus.
Teams of space monkeys plant basil and thyme and lettuce and starts of
witch hazel and eucalyptus and mock orange and mint in a kaleidoscope
knot pattern. A rose window in every shade of green. And other teams go
out at night and kill the slugs and snails by candlelight. Another team of
space monkeys picks only the most perfect
leaves and juniper berries to boil for a natural dye. Comfrey because it's a
natural disinfectant. Violet leaves because they cure headaches and sweet
woodruff because it gives soap a cut-grass smell.
