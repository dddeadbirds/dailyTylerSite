Chapter 26

IN MY FATHER'S house are many mansions. Of course, when I pulled
the trigger, I died.
Liar.
And Tyler died.
With the police helicopters thundering toward us, and Marla and all the
support group people who couldn't save themselves, with all of them
trying to save me, I had to pull the trigger.
This was better than real life.
And your one perfect moment won't last forever.
Everything in heaven is white on white.
Faker.
Everything in heaven is quiet, rubber-soled shoes.
I can sleep in heaven.
People write to me in heaven and tell me I'm remembered. That I'm their
hero. I'll get better.
The angels here are the Old Testament kind, legions and lieutenants, a
heavenly host who works in shifts, days, swing. Graveyard. They bring
you your meals on a tray with a paper cup of meds. The Valley of the
Dolls playset.
I've met God across his long walnut desk with his diplomas hanging on the
wall behind him, and God asks me, "Why?"
Why did I cause so much pain?
Didn't I realize that each of us is a sacred, unique snowflake of special
unique specialness?
Can't I see how we're all manifestations of love?
I look at God behind his desk, taking notes on a pad, but God's got this all
wrong.
We are not special.
We are not crap or trash, either.
We just are.
We just are, and what happens just happens.
And God says, "No, that's not right."
