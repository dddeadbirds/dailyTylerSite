God."
Behind us, my job and my office are smaller, smaller, smaller, gone.

This is all Tyler Durden dogma. Scrawled on bits of paper while I was

Even my boss has probably read it all.
"What you end up doing," the mechanic says, "is you spend your life
searching for a father and God."
"What you have to consider," he says, "is the possibility that God doesn't

Only if we're caught and punished can we be saved.
"Burn the Louvre," the mechanic says, "and wipe your ass with the Mona

the stars in the sky.
