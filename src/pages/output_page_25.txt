Chapter 4
THE SECURITY TASK force guy explained everything to me.
Baggage handlers can ignore a ticking suitcase. The security task force
guy, he called baggage handlers Throwers. Modern bombs don't tick. But
a suitcase that vibrates, the baggage handlers, the Throwers, have to call
the police.
How I came to live with Tyler is because most airlines have this policy
about vibrating baggage.
My flight back from Dulles, I had everything in that one bag. When you
travel a lot, you learn to pack the same for every trip. Six white shirts.
Two black trousers. The bare minimum you need to survive.
Traveling alarm clock.
Cordless electric razor.
Toothbrush.
Six pair underwear.
Six pair black socks.
It turns out, my suitcase was vibrating on departure from Dulles,
according to the security task force guy, so the police took it off the flight.
Everything was in that bag. My contact lens stuff. One red tie with blue
stripes. One blue tie with red stripes. These are regimental stripes, not club
tie stripes. And one solid red tie.
A list of all these things used to hang on the inside of my bedroom door at
home.
Home was a condominium on the fifteenth floor of a high-rise, a sort of
filing cabinet for widows and young professionals. The marketing
brochure promised a foot of concrete floor, ceiling, and wall between me
and any adjacent stereo or turned-up television. A foot of concrete and air
conditioning, you couldn't open the windows so even with maple flooring
and dimmer switches, all seventeen hundred airtight feet would smell like
the last meal you cooked or your last trip to the bathroom.
Yeah, and there were butcher block countertops and low-voltage track
lighting.
