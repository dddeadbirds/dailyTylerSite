The stuff in the Federal Express package, I tell Tyler in the Impala, that
was the same stuff we made soap out of. Ever since silicone turned out to
be dangerous, collagen has become the hot item to I gave injected to
smooth out wrinkles or to puff up thin lips or weak chins. The way Marla
had explained it, most collagen you get cheap from cow fat that's been
sterilized and processed, but that kind of cheap collagen doesn't last very
long in your body. Wherever you get injected, say in your lips, your body
rejects it and starts to poop it out. Six months later, you have thin lips,
again.
The best kind of collagen, Marla said, is your own fat, sucked out of your
thighs, processed and cleaned and injected back into your lips, or
wherever. This kind of collagen will last.
This stuff in the fridge at home, it was Marla's collagen trust fund.
Whenever her mom grew any extra fat, she had it sucked out and
packaged. Marla says the process is called gleaning. If Marla's mom
doesn't need the collagen herself, she sends the packets to Marla. Marla
never has any fat of her own, and her mom figures that familial collagen
would be better than Marla ever having to use the cheap cow kind.
Streetlight along the boulevard comes through the sales agreement m the
window and prints "AS IS" on Tyler's cheek.
"Spiders," Tyler says, "could lay their eggs and larva could tunnel, under
your skin. That's how bad your life can get."
Right now, my Almond Chicken in its warm, creamy sauce tastes like
something sucked out of Marla's mother's thighs.
It was right then, standing in the kitchen with Marla, that I knew what
Tyler had done.
HIDEOUSLY WRINKLED.
And I knew why he sent candy to Marla's mother.
PLEASE HELP.
I say, Marla, you don't want to look in the freezer.
Marla says, "Do what?"
"We never eat red meat," Tyler tells me in the Impala, and he can't use
chicken fat or the soap won't harden into a bar. "The stuff," Tyler says, "is
making us a fortune. We paid the rent with that collagen."
I say, you should've told Marla. Now she thinks I did it.
