A cathode ray tube, CRT, you either remove the plastic housing around
the tube, this is easy enough, or you work through the vent panels in the
top of the housing.
First you have to unplug the monitor from the power source and from the
computer.
This would also work with a television.
Just understand, if there's a spark, even static electricity from the carpet,
you're dead. Screaming, burned-alive dead.
A cathode ray tube can hold 300 volts of passive electrical storage, so use
a hefty screwdriver across the main power supply capacitor, first. If you're
dead at this point, you didn't use an insulated screwdriver.
There's a vacuum inside the cathode ray tube so the moment you drill
through, the tube will suck air, sort of inhale a little whistle of it.
Ream the little hole with a larger bit, then a larger bit, until you can put the
tip of a funnel into the hole. Then, fill the tube with your choice of
explosive. Homemade napalm is good. Gasoline or gasoline mixed with
frozen orange juice concentrate or cat litter.
A sort of fun explosive is potassium permanganate mixed with powdered
sugar. The idea is to mix one ingredient that will burn very F fast with a
second ingredient that will supply enough oxygen for that burning. This
burns so fast, it's an explosion.
Barium peroxide and zinc dust.
Ammonium nitrate and powdered aluminum.
The nouvelle cuisine of anarchy.
Barium nitrate in a sauce of sulfur and garnished with charcoal. That's
your basic gunpowder.
Bon appetit.
Pack the computer monitor full of this, and when someone turns on the
power, this is five or six pounds of gunpowder exploding in their face.
The problem is, I sort of liked my boss.
If you're male, and you're Christian and living in America, your father is
your model for God. And sometimes you find your father in your career.
Except Tyler didn't like my boss.
The police would be looking for me. I was the last person out of the
building last Friday night. I woke up at my desk with my breath condensed
