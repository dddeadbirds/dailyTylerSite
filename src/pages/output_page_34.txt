Like Tyler says, even a snuffle looks pumped.
My father never went to college so it was really important I go to college.
After college, I called him long distance and said, now what?
My dad didn't know.
When I got a job and turned twenty-five, long distance, I said, now what?
My dad didn't know, so he said, get married.
I'm a thirty-year-old boy, and I'm wondering if another woman is really
the answer I need.
What happens at fight club doesn't happen in words. Some guys need a
fight every week. This week, Tyler says it's the first fifty guys through the
door and that's it. No more.
Last week, I tapped a guy and he and I got on the list for a fight. This guy
must've had a bad week, got both my arms behind my head in a full nelson
and rammed my face into the concrete floor until my teeth bit open the
inside of my cheek and my eye was swollen shut and was bleeding, and
after I said, stop, I could look down and there was a print of half my face
in blood on the floor.
Tyler stood next to me, both of us looking down at the big O of my mouth
with blood all around it and the little slit of my eye staring up at us from
the floor, and Tyler says, "Cool."
I shake the guy's hand and say, good fight.
This guy, he says, "How about next week?"
I try to smile against all the swelling, and I say, look at me. How about
next month?
You aren't alive anywhere like you're alive at fight club. When it's you and
one other guy under that one light in the middle of all those watching.
Fight club isn't about winning or losing fights. Fight club isn't about
words. You see a guy come to fight club for the first time, and his ass is a
loaf of white bread. You see this same guy here six months later, and he
looks carved out of wood. This guy trusts himself to handle anything.
There's grunting and noise at fight club like at the gym, but fight club isn't
about looking good. There's hysterical shouting in tongues like at church,
and when you wake up Sunday afternoon you feel saved.
