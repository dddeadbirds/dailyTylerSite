The waiter thinks I'm Tyler Durden, I say.
In that case, Marla orders fried clams and clam chowder and a fish basket
and fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate
chiffon pie.
Through the pass-through window into the kitchen, three line cooks, one
with stitches along his upper lip, are watching Marla and me and
whispering with their three bruised heads together. I tell the waiter, give us
clean food, please. Please, don't be doing any trash to the stuff we order.
"In that case, sir," our waiter says, "may I advise against the lady, here,
eating the clam chowder."
Thank you. No clam chowder. Marla looks at me, and I tell her, trust me.
The waiter turns on his heel and marches our order back to the kitchen.
Through the kitchen pass-through window, the three line cooks give me
the thumbs-up.
Marla says, "You get some nice perks, being Tyler Durden."
From now on, I tell Marla, she has to follow me everywhere at night, and
write down everywhere I go. Who do I see. Do I castrate anyone
important. That sort of detail.
I take out my wallet and show Marla my driver's license with my real
name.
Not Tyler Durden.
"But everyone knows you're Tyler Durden," Marla says.
Everyone but me.
Nobody at work calls me Tyler Durden. My boss calls me by my real
name.
My parents know who I really am.
"So why," Marla asks, "are you Tyler Durden to some people but not to
everybody?"
The first time I met Tyler, I was asleep.
I was tired and crazy and rushed, and every time I boarded a plane, I
wanted the plane to crash. I envied people dying of cancer. I hated my life.
I was tired and bored with my job and my furniture, and I couldn't see any
way to change things.
Only end them.
I felt trapped.
