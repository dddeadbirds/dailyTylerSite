pages for cocaine envelopes. There's no lock on the front door from when
police or whoever kicked in the door. There's nine layers of wallpaper
swelling on the dining-room walls, flowers under stripes under flowers
under birds under grasscloth.
Our only neighbors are a closed machine shop and across the street, a
blocklong warehouse. Inside the house, there's a closet with sevenfoot
rollers for rolling up damask tablecloths so they never have to be creased.
There's a cedarlined, refrigerated fur closet. The tile in the bathroom is
painted with little flowers nicer than most everybody's wedding china, and
there's a used condom in the toilet.
I've been living with Tyler about a month.
I am Joe's White Knuckles.
How could Tyler not fall for that. The night before last, Tyler sat up alone,
splicing sex organs into Snow White.
How could I compete for Tyler's attention.
I am Joe's Enraged, Inflamed Sense of Rejection.
What's worse is this is all my fault. After I went to sleep last night, Tyler
tells me he came home from his shift as a banquet waiter, and Marla called
again from the Regent Hotel. This was it, Marla said. The tunnel, the light
leading her down the tunnel. The death experience was so cool, Marla
wanted me to hear her describe it as she lifted out of her body and floated
up.
Marla didn't know if her spirit could use the telephone, but she wanted
someone to at least hear her last breath.
No, but no, Tyler answers the phone and misunderstands the whole
situation.
They've never met so Tyler thinks it's a bad thing that Marla is about to
die.
It's nothing of the kind.
This is none of Tyler's business, but Tyler calls the police and Tyler races
over to the Regent Hotel.
Now, according to the ancient Chinese custom we all learned from
television, Tyler is responsible for Marla, forever, because Tyler saved
Marla's life.
