Marla's cold and sweating while I tell her how in college I had a wart
once. On my penis, only I say, dick. I went to the medical school to have it
removed. The wart. Afterwards, I told my father. This was years after, and
my dad laughed and told me I was a fool because warts like that are
nature's French tickler. Women love them and God was doing me a favor.
Kneeling next to Marla's bed with my hands still cold from outside,
feeling Marla's cold skin a little at a time, rubbing a little of Marla
between my fingers every inch, Marla says those warts that are God's
French ticklers give women cervical cancer.
So I was sitting on the paper belt in an examining room at the medical
school while a medical student sprays a canister of liquid nitrogen on my
dick and eight medical students watched. This is where you
end up if you don't have medical insurance. Only they don't call it a dick,
they called it a penis, and whatever you call it, spray it with liquid nitrogen
and you might as well burn it with lye, it hurts so bad.
Marla laughs at this until she sees my fingers have stopped. Like maybe
I've found something.
Marla stops breathing and her stomach goes like a drum, and her heart is
like a fist pounding from inside the tight skin of a drum. But no, I stopped
because I'm talking, and I stopped because, for a minute, neither of us was
in Marla's bedroom. We were in the medical school years ago, sitting on
the sticky paper with my dick on fire with liquid nitrogen when one of the
medical students saw my bare feet and left the room fast in two big steps.
The student came back in behind three real doctors, and the doctors
elbowed the man with the canister of liquid nitrogen to one side.
A real doctor grabbed my bare right foot and hefted it into the face of the
other real doctors. The three turned it and poked it and took Polaroid
pictures of the foot, and it was as if the rest of the person, half dressed
with God's gift half frozen, didn't exist. Only the foot, and the rest of the
medical students pressed in to see.
"How long," a doctor asked, "have you had this red blotch on your foot?"
The doctor meant my birthmark. On my right foot is a birthmark that my
father jokes looks like a dark red Australia with a little New Zealand right
next to it. This is what I told them and it let all the air out of everything.
My dick was thawing out. Everyone except the student with the nitrogen
