Tyler was the pawn of the world, everybody's trash.
This is what Tyler rehearsed me to tell the manager of the Pressman Hotel,
too.
At Tyler's other job, at the Pressman Hotel, Tyler said he was nobody.
Nobody cared if he lived or died, and the feeling was fucking mutual. This
is what Tyler told me to say in the hotel manager's office with security
guards sitting outside the door.
Tyler and I stayed up late and traded stories after everything was over.
Right after he'd gone to the projectionist union, Tyler had me go and
confront the manager of the Pressman Hotel.
Tyler and I were looking more and more like identical twins. Both of us
had punched-out cheekbones, and our skin had lost its memory, and forgot
where to slide back to after we were hit.
My bruises were from fight club, and Tyler's face was punched out of
shape by the president of the projectionist union. After Tyler crawled out
of the union offices, I went to see the manager of the Pressman Hotel.
I sat there, in the office of the manager of the Pressman Hotel.
I am Joe's Smirking Revenge.
The first thing the hotel manager said was I had three minutes. In the first
thirty seconds, I told how I'd been peeing into soup, farting on creme
brulees, sneezing on braised endive, and now I wanted the hotel to send
me a check every week equivalent to my average week's pay plus tips. In
return, I wouldn't come to work anymore, and I wouldn't go to the
newspapers or the public health people with a confused, tearful
confession.
The headlines:
Troubled Waiter Admits Tainting Food.
Sure, I said, I might go to prison. They could hang me and yank my nuts
off and drag me through the streets and flay my skin and burn me with lye,
but the Pressman Hotel would always be known as the hotel where the
richest people in the world ate pee.
Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.
And I used to be such a nice person.
