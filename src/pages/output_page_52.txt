There's the smell of lye scalding the branched shape of your sinuses, and
the hospital vomit smell of piss and vinegar.
"It was right to kill all those people," Tyler says.
The back of your hand is swollen red and glossy as a pair of lips in the
exact shape of Tyler's kiss. Scattered around the kiss are the cigarette burn
spots of somebody crying.
"Open your eyes," Tyler says, and his face is shining with tears.
"Congratulations," Tyler says. "You're a step closer to hitting bottom.
"You have to see," Tyler says, "how the first soap was made of heroes."
Think about the animals used in product testing.
Think about the monkeys shot into space.
"Without their death, their pain, without their sacrifice," Tyler says, "we
would have nothing."
I S T O P T H E elevator between floors while Tyler undoes his belt.
When the elevator stops, the soup bowls stacked an the buffet cart stop
rattling, and steam mushrooms up to the elevator ceiling as Tyler takes the
lid off the soup tureen.
Tyler starts to take himself out and says, "Don't look at me, or I can't go."
The soup's a sweet tomato bisque with cilantro and clams. Between the
two, nobody will smell anything else we put in.
I say, hurry up, and I look back over my shoulder at Tyler with his last
half inch hanging in the soup. This looks in a really funny way like a tall
elephant in a waiter's white shirt and bow tie drinking soup through its
little trunk.
Tyler says, "I said, `Don't look."'
The elevator door in front of me has a little face-sized window that lets me
look out into the banquet service corridor. With the elevator stopped
between floors, my view is about a cockroach above the green linoleum,
and from here at cockroach level the green corridor stretches toward the
vanishing point, past half-open doors where titans and their gigantic wives
drink barrels of champagne and bellow at each other wearing diamonds
bigger than I feel.
Last week, I tell Tyler, when the Empire State Lawyers were here for their
Christmas party, I got mine hard and stuck it in all their orange mousses.
