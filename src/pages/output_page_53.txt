Last week, Tyler says, he stopped the elevator and farted on a whole cart
of Boccone Dolce for the Junior League tea.
That Tyler knows how a meringue will absorb odor.
At cockroach level, we can hear the captive harpist make music as the
titans lift forks of butterflied lamb chop, each bite the size of a whole pig,
each mouth a tearing Stonehenge of ivory.

Tyler says, "I can't."
If the soup gets cold, they'll send it back.
The giants, they'll send something back to the kitchen for no reason at all.
They just want to see you run around for their money. A dinner like this,

they know they can't threaten you with the pp, to them you're just a
cockroach.
