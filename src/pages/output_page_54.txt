on steel legs attached to a hillside. Part of the way through the fish course,
while Tyler's rinsing plates from the pasta course, the hostess comes in the
kitchen holding a scrap of paper that flaps like a flag, her hand is shaking
so much. Through her clenched teeth, Madam wants to know did the
waiters see any of the guests go down the hallway that leads to the
bedroom part of the house? Especially any of the women guests? Or the
host?
In the kitchen, it's Tyler and Albert and Len and Jerry rinsing and stacking
the plates and a prep cook, Leslie, basting garlic butter on the artichoke
hearts stuffed with shrimp and escargot.
"We're not supposed to go in that part of the house," Tyler says.
We come in through the garage. All we're supposed to see is the garage,
the kitchen, and the dining room.
The host comes in behind his wife in the kitchen doorway and takes the
scrap of paper out of her shaking hand. "This will be alright," he says.
"How can I face those people," Madam says, "unless I know who did
this?"
The host puts a flat open hand against the back of her silky white
party dress that matches her house and Madam straightens up, her
shoulders squared, and is all of a sudden quiet. "They are your guests," he
says. "And this party is very important."
This looks in a really funny way like a ventriloquist bringing his dummy
to life. Madam looks at her husband, and with a little shove the host takes
his wife back into the dining room. The note drops to the floor and the
two-way swish-swish of the kitchen door sweeps the note against Tyler's
feet.
Albert says, "What's it say?"
Len goes out to start clearing the fish course.
Leslie slides the tray of artichoke hearts back into the oven and says,
"What's it say, already?"
Tyler looks right at Leslie and says, without even picking up the note, " `I
have passed an amount of urine into at least one of your many elegant
fragrances."'
Albert smiles. "You pissed in her perfume?"
