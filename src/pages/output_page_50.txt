Guided meditation.
You're in Ireland. Close your eyes.
You're in Ireland the summer after you left college, and you're drinking at
a pub near the castle where every day busloads of English and American
tourists come to kiss the Blarney stone.
"Don't shut this out," Tyler says. "Soap and human sacrifice go hand in
hand."
You leave the pub in a stream of men, walking through the beaded wet car
silence of streets where it's just rained. It's night. Until you get to the
Blarneystone castle.
The floors in the castle are rotted away, and you climb the rock stairs with
blackness getting deeper and deeper on every side with every step up.
Everybody is quiet with the climb and the tradition of this little act of
rebellion.
"Listen to me," Tyler says. "Open your eyes.
"In ancient history," Tyler says, "human sacrifices were made on a hill
above a river. Thousands of people. Listen to me. The sacrifices were
made and the bodies were burned on a pyre.
"You can cry," Tyler says. "You can go to the sink and run water over
your hand, but first you have to know that you're stupid and you will die.
Look at me.
"Someday," Tyler says, "you will die, and until you know that, you're
useless to me."
You're in Ireland.
"You can cry," Tyler says, "but every tear that lands in the lye flakes on
your skin will burn a cigarette burn scar."
Guided meditation. You're in Ireland the summer after you left college,
and maybe this is where you first wanted anarchy. Years before you met
Tyler Durden, before you peed in your first creme anglaise, you learned
about little acts of rebellion.
In Ireland.
You're standing on a platform at the top of the stairs in a castle.
"We can use vinegar," Tyler says, "to neutralize the burning, but first you
have to give up."
