enough in the projector that the sprockets are punching a line of holes
through the sound track.
After a movie has been sprocket run, the light of the bulb shines through
the sound track and instead of talk, you're blasted with the helicopter blade
sound of whop whop whop as each burst of light comes through a sprocket
hole.
What else a projectionist shouldn't do: Tyler makes slides out of the best
single frames from a movie. The first full frontal movie anyone can
remember had the naked actress Angle Dickinson.
By the time a print of this movie had shipped from the West Coast theaters
to the East Coast theaters, the nude scene was gone. One projectionist took
a frame. Another projectionist took a frame. Everybody wanted to make a
naked slide of Angle Dickinson. Porno got into theaters and these
projectionists, some guys they built collections that got epic.
You wake up at Boeing Field.
You wake up at LAX.
We have an almost empty flight, tonight, so feel free to fold the armrests
up into the seatbacks and stretch out. You stretch out, zigzag, knees bent,
waist bent, elbows bent across three or four seats. I set my watch two
hours earlier or three hours later, Pacific, Mountain, Central, or Eastern
time; lose an hour, gain an hour.
This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time.
You wake up at Cleveland Hopkins.
You wake up at SeaTac, again.
You're a projectionist and you're tired and angry, but mostly you're bored
so you start by taking a single frame of pornography collected by some
other projectionist that you find stashed away in the booth, and you splice
this frame of a lunging red penis or a yawning wet vagina closeup into
another feature movie.
This is one of those pet adventures, when the dog and cat are left behind
by a traveling family and must find their way home. In reel three, just after
the dog and cat, who have human voices and talk to each other, have eaten
out of a garbage can, there's the flash of an erection.
Tyler does this.
