want, but the second you fall asleep, I take over, and you become Tyler
Durden."
But we fought, I say. The night we invented fight club.
"You weren't really fighting me," Tyler says. "You said so yourself. You
were fighting everything you hate in your life."
But I can see you.
"You're asleep."
But you're renting a house. You held a job. Two jobs.
Tyler says, "Order your canceled checks from the bank. I rented the house
in your name. I think you'll find the handwriting on the rent checks
matches the notes you've been typing for me."
Tyler's been spending my money. It's no wonder I'm always overdrawn.
"And the jobs, well, why do you think you're so tired. Geez, it's not
insomnia. As soon as you fall asleep, I take over and go to work or fight
club or whatever. You're lucky I didn't get a job as a snake handler."
I say, but what about Marla?
"Marla loves you."
Marla loves you.
"Marla doesn't know the difference between you and me. You
gave her a fake name the night you met. You never gave your real name at
a support group, you inauthentic shit. Since I saved her life, Marla thinks
your name is Tyler Durden."
So, now that I know about Tyler, will he just disappear?
"No," Tyler says, still holding my hand, "I wouldn't be here in the first
place if you didn't want me. I'll still live my life while you're asleep, but if
you fuck with me, if you chain yourself to the bed at night or take big
doses of sleeping pills, then we'll be enemies. And I'll get you for it."
Oh, this is bullshit. This is a dream. Tyler is a projection. He's a
disassociative personality disorder. A psychogenic fugue state. Tyler
Durden is my hallucination.
"Fuck that shit," Tyler says. "Maybe you're my schizophrenic
hallucination."
I was here first.
Tyler says, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, well let's just see who's here last."
This isn't real. This is a dream, and I'll wake up.
