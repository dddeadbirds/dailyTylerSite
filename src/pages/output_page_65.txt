Chapter 9

MY BOSS STANDS too close to my desk with his little smile, his lips
together and stretched thin, his crotch at my elbow. I look up from writing
the cover letter for a recall campaign. These letters always begin the same
way:
"This notice is sent to you in accordance with the requirements of the
National Motor Vehicle Safety Act. We have determined that a defect
exists . . ."
This week I ran the liability formula, and for once A times B times C
equaled more than the cost of a recall.
This week, it's the little plastic clip that holds the rubber blade on your
windshield wipers. A throwaway item. Only two hundred vehicles
affected. Next to nothing for the labor cost.
Last week was more typical. Last week the issue was some leather cured
with a known teratogenic substance, synthetic Nirret or something just as
illegal that's still used in third world tanning. Something so strong that it
could cause birth defects in the fetus of any pregnant woman who comes
across it. Last week, nobody called the Department of Transportation.
Nobody initiated a recall.
New leather multiplied by labor cost multiplied by administration cost
would equal more than our first-quarter profits. If anyone ever discovers
our mistake, we can still pay off a lot of grieving families before we come
close to the cost of retrofitting sixty-five hundred leather interiors.
But this week, we're doing a recall campaign. And this week the insomnia
is back. Insomnia, and now the whole world figures to stop by and take a
dump on my grave.
My boss is wearing his gray tie so today must be a Tuesday.
My boss brings a sheet of paper to my desk and asks if I'm looking for
something. This paper was left in the copy machine, he says, and begins to
read:
"The first rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club."
His eyes go side to side across the paper, and he giggles.
