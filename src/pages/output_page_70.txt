Chapter 10

WHEN I GET to the Regent Hotel, Marla's in the lobby wearing a
bathrobe. Marla called me at work and asked, would I skip the gym and
the library or the laundry or whatever I had planned after work and come
see her, instead.
This is why Marla called, because she hates me.
She doesn't say a thing about her collagen trust fund.
What Marla says is, would I do her a favor? Marla was lying in bed this
afternoon. Marla lives on the meals that Meals on Wheels delivers for her
neighbors who are dead; Marla accepts the meals and says they're asleep.
Long story short, this afternoon Marla was just lying in bed, waiting for
the Meals on Wheels delivery between noon and two. Marla hasn't had
health insurance for a couple years so she's stopped looking, but this
morning she looks and there seemed to be a lump and the nodes under her
arm near the lump were hard and tender at the same time and she couldn't
tell anyone she loves because she doesn't want to scare them and she can't
afford to see a doctor if this is nothing, but she needed to talk to someone
and someone else needed to look.
The color of Marla's brown eyes is like an animal that's been heated in a
furnace and dropped into cold water. They call that vulcanized or
galvanized or tempered.
Marla says she'll forgive the collagen thing if I'll help her look.
I figure she doesn't call Tyler because she doesn't want to scare him. I'm
neutral in her book, I owe her.
We go upstairs to her room, and Marla tells me how in the wild you don't
see old animals because as soon as they age, animals die. If they get sick
or slow down, something stronger kills them. Animals aren't meant to get
old.
Marla lies down on her bed and undoes the tie on her bathrobe, and says
our culture has made death something wrong. Old animals should be an
unnatural exception.
Freaks.
