If I knew how this would all turn out, I'd be more than happy to be dead
and in Heaven right now.
Seven minutes.
Up on top of the Parker-Morris Building with Tyler's gun in my mouth.
While desks and filing cabinets and computers meteor down on the crowd
around the building and smoke funnels up from the broken windows and
three blocks down the street the demolition team watches the clock, I
know all of this: the gun, the anarchy, the explosion is really about Marla
Singer.
Six minutes.
We have sort of a triangle thing going here. I want Tyler. Tyler wants
Marla. Marla wants me.
I don't want Marla, and Tyler doesn't want me around, not anymore. This
isn't about love as in caring. This is about property as in ownership.
Without Marla, Tyler would have nothing.
Five minutes.
Maybe we would become a legend, maybe not. No, I say, but wait.
Where would Jesus be if no one had written the gospels?
Four minutes.
I tongue the gun barrel into my cheek and say, you want to be a legend,
Tyler, man, I'll make you a legend. I've been here from the beginning.
I remember everything.
Three minutes.
