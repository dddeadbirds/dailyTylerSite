You wake up at JFK.
I melt and swell at the moment of landing when one wheel thuds on the
runway but the plane leans to one side and hangs in the decision to right
itself or roll. For this moment, nothing matters. Look up into the stars and
you're gone. Not your luggage. Nothing matters. Not your bad breath. The
windows are dark outside and the turbine engines roar backward. The
cabin hangs at the wrong angle under the roar of the turbines, and you will
never have to file another expense account claim. Receipt required for
items over twenty-five dollars. You will never have to get another haircut.
A thud, and the second wheel hits the tarmac. The staccato of a hundred
seatbelt buckles snapping open, and the single-use friend you almost died
sitting next to says:
I hope you make your connection.
Yeah, me too.
And this is how long your moment lasted. And life goes on.
And somehow, by accident, Tyler and I met.
It was time for a vacation.
You wake up at LAX.
Again.
How I met Tyler was I went to a nude beach. This was the very end of
summer, and I was asleep. Tyler was naked and sweating, gritty with sand,
his hair wet and stringy, hanging in his face.
Tyler had been around a long time before we met.
Tyler was pulling driftwood logs out of the surf and dragging them up the
beach. In the wet sand, he'd already planted a half circle of logs so they
stood a few inches apart and as tall as his eyes. There were four logs, and
when I woke up, I watched Tyler pull a fifth log up the beach. Tyler dug a
hole under one end of the log, then lifted the other end until the log slid
into the hole and stood there at a slight angle.
You wake up at the beach.
We were the only people on the beach.
With a stick, Tyler drew a straight line in the sand several feet away. Tyler
went back to straighten the log by stamping sand around its base.
I was the only person watching this.
Tyler called over, "Do you know what time it is?"
