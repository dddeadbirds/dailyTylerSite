The introductions, everybody, this is Marla Singer, and this is her first
time with us.
Hi, Marla.
At Above and Beyond, we start with the Catch-Up Rap. The group isn't
called Parasitic Brain Parasites. You'll never hear anyone say "parasite."
Everybody is always getting better. Oh, this new medication. Everyone's
always just turned the corner. Still, everywhere, there's the squint of a
five-day headache. A woman wipes at involuntary tears. Everyone gets a
name tag, and people you've met every Tuesday night for a year, they
come at you, handshake hand ready and their eyes on your name tag.
I don't believe we've met.
No one will ever say parasite. They'll say, agent.
They don't say cure. They'll say, treatment.
In Catch-Up Rap, someone will say how the agent has spread into his
spinal column and now all of a sudden he'll have no control of his left
hand. The agent, someone will say, has dried the lining of his brain so now
the brain pulls away from the inside of his skull, causing seizures.
The last time I was here, the woman named Chloe announced the only
good news she had. Chloe pushed herself to her feet against the wooden
arms of her chair and said she no longer had any fear of death.
Tonight, after the introductions and Catch-Up Rap, a girl I don't know,
with a name tag that says Glenda, says she's Chloe's sister and that at two
in the morning last Tuesday, Chloe finally died.
Oh, this should be so sweet. For two years, Chloe's been crying in my
arms during hug time, and now she's dead, dead in the ground, dead in an
urn, mausoleum, columbarium. Oh, the proof that one day you're thinking
and hauling yourself around, and the next, you're cold fertilizer, worm
buffet. This is the amazing miracle of death, and it should be so sweet if it
weren't for, oh, that one.
Marla.
Oh, and Marla's looking at me again, singled out among all the brain
parasites.
Liar.
Faker.
