Organized Chaos. The Bureaucracy of Anarchy. You figure it out.
Support groups. Sort of.
So Tuesday night, the Assault Committee proposed events for the
upcoming week, and Tyler read the proposals and gave the committee its
homework.
By this time next week, each guy on the Assault Committee has to pick a
fight where he won't come out a hero. And not in fight club. This is harder
than it sounds. A man on the street will do anything not to fight.
The idea is to take some Joe on the street who's never been in a fight and
recruit him. Let him experience winning for the first time in his life. Get
him to explode. Give him permission to beat the crap out of you.
You can take it. If you win, you screwed up.
"What we have to do, people," Tyler told the committee, "is remind these
guys what kind of power they still have."
This is Tyler's little pep talk. Then he opened each of the folded squares of
paper in the cardboard box in front of him. This is how each committee
proposes events for the upcoming week. Write the event on the committee
tablet. Tear off the sheet, fold it, and put it in the box. Tyler checks out the
proposals and throws out any bad ideas.
For each idea he throws out, Tyler puts a folded blank into the box.
Then everyone in the committee takes a paper out of the box. The way
Tyler explained the process to me, if somebody draws a blank, he only has
his homework to do that week.
If you draw a proposal, then you have to go to the import beer festival this
weekend and push over a guy in a chemical toilet. You'll get extra favor if
you get beat up for doing this. Or you have to attend the fashion show at
the shopping center atrium and throw strawberry gelatin from the
mezzanine.
If you get arrested, you're off the Assault Committee. If you laugh, you're
off the committee.
Nobody knows who draws a proposal, and nobody except Tyler knows
what all the proposals are and which are accepted and which proposals he
throws in the trash. Later that week, you might read in the newspaper
about an unidentified man, downtown, jumping the driver of a Jaguar
convertible and steering the car into a fountain.
