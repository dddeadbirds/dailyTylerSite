Tyler and Marla are never in the same room. I never see them together.
Still, you never see me and Zsa Zsa Gabor together, and this doesn't mean
we're the same person. Tyler just doesn't come out when Marla's around.
So I can wash the pants, Tyler has to show me how to make soap. Tyler's
upstairs, and the kitchen is filled with the smell of cloves and burnt hair.
Marla's at the kitchen table, burning the inside of her arm with a clove
cigarette and calling herself human butt wipe.
"I embrace my own festering diseased corruption," Marla tells the cherry
on the end of her cigarette. Marla twists the cigarette into the soft white
belly of her arm. "Burn, witch, burn."
Tyler's upstairs in my bedroom, looking at his teeth in my mirror, and says
he got me a job as a banquet waiter, part time.
"At the Pressman Hotel, if you can work in the evening," Tyler says. "The
job will stoke your class hatred."
Yeah, I say, whatever.
"They make you wear a black bow tie," Tyler says. "All you need to work
there is a white shirt and black trousers."
Soap, Tyler. I say, we need soap. We need to make some soap. I need to
wash my pants.
I hold Tyler's feet while he does two hundred sit-ups.
"To make soap, first we have to render fat." Tyler is full of useful
information.
Except for their humping, Marla and Tyler are never in the same room. If
Tyler's around, Marla ignores him. This is familiar ground.
"The big sleep, `Valley of the Dogs' style.
"Where even if someone loves you enough to save your life, they still
castrate you." Marla looks at me as if I'm the one humping her and says, "I
can't win with you, can I?"
Marla goes out the back door singing that creepy "Valley of the Dolls"
song.
I just stare at her going.
There's one, two, three moments of silence until all of Marla is gone from
the room.
I turn around, and Tyler's appeared.
Tyler says, "Did you get rid of her?"
