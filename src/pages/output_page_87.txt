There's a sleeper hold that gives somebody just enough air to stay awake,
and that night at fight club I hit our first-timer and hammered that
beautiful mister angel face, first with the bony knuckles of my fist like a
pounding molar, and then the knotted tight butt of my fist after my
knuckles were raw from his teeth stuck through his lips. Then the I, id fell
through my arms in a heap.
Tyler told me later that he'd never seen me destroy something so
completely. That night, Tyler knew he had to take fight club up a notch or
shut it down.
Tyler said, sitting at breakfast the next morning, "You looked like a
maniac, Psycho-Boy. Where did you go?"
1 said I felt like crap and not relaxed at all. I didn't get any kind of n buzz.
Maybe I'd developed a Jones. You can build up a tolerance to fighting, and
maybe I needed to move on to something bigger.
It was that morning, Tyler invented Project Mayhem.
Tyler asked what I was really fighting.
What Tyler says about being the crap and the slaves of history, that's I n
>w I felt. I wanted to destroy everything beautiful I'd never have. Burn the
Amazon rain forests. Pump chlorofluorocarbons straight up o > gobble the
ozone. Open the dump valves on supertankers and uncap offshore oil
wells. I wanted to kill all the fish I couldn't afford n ) eat, and smother the
French beaches I'd never see.
I wanted the whole world to hit bottom.
Pounding that kid, I really wanted to put a bullet between the eyes every
endangered panda that wouldn't screw to save its species and every whale
or dolphin that gave up and ran itself aground.
Don't think of this as extinction. Think of this as downsizing.
For thousands of years, human beings had screwed up and trashed and
crapped on this planet, and now history expected me to clean up after
everyone. I have to wash out and flatten my soup cans. And account for
every drop of used motor oil.
And I have to foot the bill for nuclear waste and buried gasoline tanks and
landfilled toxic sludge dumped a generation before I was born.
I held the face of mister angel like a baby or a football in the crook of my
arm and bashed him with my knuckles, bashed him until his teeth broke
