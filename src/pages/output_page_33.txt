really nice condo and car. Really, really nice, until the dust settled or the
next owner. Nothing is static. Even the Mona Lira is falling apart. Since
fight club, I can wiggle half the teeth in my jaw.
Maybe self-improvement isn't the answer.
Tyler never knew his father.
Maybe self-destruction is the answer.
Tyler and I still go to fight club, together. Fight club is in the basement of
a bar, now, after the bar closes on Saturday night, and every week you go
and there's more guys there.
Tyler gets under the one light in the middle of the black concrete basement
and he can see that light flickering back out of the dark in a hundred pairs
of eyes. First thing Tyler yells is, "The first rule about fight club is you
don't talk about fight club.
"The second rule about fight club," Tyler yells, "is you don't talk about
fight club."
Me, I knew my dad for about six years, but I don't remember anything. My
dad, he starts a new family in a new town about every six years. This isn't
so much like a family as it's like he sets up a franchise.
What you see at fight club is a generation of men raised by women.
Tyler standing under the one light in the after-midnight blackness of a
basement full of men, Tyler runs through the other rules: two men per
fight, one fight at a time, no shoes no shirts, fights go on as long as they
have to.
"And the seventh rule," Tyler yells, "is if this is your first night at fight
club, you have to fight."
Fight club is not football on television. You aren't watching a bunch of
men you don't know halfway around the world beating on each other live
by satellite with a two-minute delay, commercials pitching beer every ten
minutes, and a pause now for station identification. After you've been to
fight club, watching football on television is watching pornography when
you could be having great sex.
Fight club gets to be your reason for going to the gym and keeping your
hair cut short and cutting your nails. The gyms you go to are crowded with
guys trying to look like men, as if being a man means looking the way a
sculptor or an art director says.
