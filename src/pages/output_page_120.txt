the turn-away numbers, that sort of thing. Look for new talent. We have
Project Mayhem in Seattle, too."
Tyler's fingertip traces the swelling along my eyebrows. "We have Project
Mayhem in Los Angeles and Detroit, a big Project Mayhem going on in
Washington, D.C., in New York. We have Project Mayhem in Chicago
like you would not believe."
Tyler says, "I can't believe you broke your promise. The first rule is you
don't talk about fight club."
He was in Seattle last week when a bartender in a neck brace told
him that the police were going to crack down on fight clubs. The police
commissioner himself wanted it special.
"What it is," Tyler says, "is we have police who come to fight at fight club
and really like it. We have newspaper reporters and law clerks and
lawyers, and we know everything before it's going to happen."
We were going to be shut down.
"At least in Seattle," Tyler says.
I ask what did Tyler do about it.
"What did we do about it," Tyler says.
We called an Assault Committee meeting.
"There isn't a me and a you, anymore," Tyler says, and he pinches the end
of my nose. "I think you've figured that out."
We both use the same body, but at different times.
"We called a special homework assignment," Tyler says. "We said, `Bring
me the steaming testicles of his esteemed honor, Seattle Police
Commissioner Whoever."'
I'm not dreaming.
"Yes," Tyler says, "you are."
We put together a team of fourteen space monkeys, and five of these space
monkeys were police, and we were every person in the park where his
honor walks his dog, tonight.
"Don't worry," Tyler says, "the dog is alright."
The whole attack took three minutes less than our best run-through. We'd
projected twelve minutes. Our best run-through was nine minutes.
We have five space monkeys hold him down.
Tyler's telling me this, but somehow, I already know it.
