Chapter 13
IT'S IN THE newspaper today how somebody broke into offices between
the tenth and fifteenth floors of the Hein Tower, and climbed out the office
windows, and painted the south side of the building with a grinning five
story mask, and set fires so the window at the center of each huge eye
blazed huge and alive and inescapable over the city at dawn.
In the picture on the front page of the newspaper, the face is an angry
pumpkin, Japanese demon, dragon of avarice hanging in the sky, and the
smoke is a witch's eyebrows or devil's horns. And people cried with their
heads thrown back.
What did it mean?
And who would do this? And even after the fires were out, the face was
still there, and it was worse. The empty eyes seemed to watch everyone in
the street but at the same time were dead.
This stuff is in the newspaper more and more.
Of course you read this, and you want to know right away if it was part of
Project Mayhem.
The newspaper says the police have no real leads. Youth gangs or space
aliens, whoever it was could've died while crawling down ledges and
dangling from windowsills with cans of black spray paint.
Was it the Mischief Committee or the Arson Committee? The giant face
was probably their homework assignment from last week.
Tyler would know, but the first rule about Project Mayhem is you don't
ask questions about Project Mayhem.
In the Assault Committee of Project Mayhem, this week Tyler says he ran
everyone through what it would take to shoot a gun. All a gun does is
focus an explosion in one direction.
At the last meeting of the Assault Committee, Tyler brought a gun and the
yellow pages of the phone book. They meet in the basement where fight
club meets on Saturday night. Each committee meets on a different night:
Arson meets on Monday.
Assault on Tuesday.
Mischief meets on Wednesday.
And Misinformation meets on Thursday.
