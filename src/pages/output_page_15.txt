clattering Gatling-gun fire. The two projectors running, you stand between
and hold the shutter lever on each. On really old projectors, you have an
alarm on the hub of the feed reel.
Even after the movie's on television, the warning dots will still be there.
Even on airplane movies.
As most of the movie rolls onto the take-up reel, the take-up reel turns
