Not a sound, not a smell, Tyler's just appeared.
"First," Tyler says and jumps from the kitchen doorway to digging in the
freezer. "First, we need to render some fat."
About my boss, Tyler tells me, if I'm really angry I should go to the post
office and fill out a change-of-address card and have all his mail
forwarded to Rugby, North Dakota.
Tyler starts pulling out sandwich bags of frozen white stuff and dropping
them in the sink. Me, I'm supposed to put a big pan on the stove and fill it
most of the way with water. Too little water, and the fat will darken as it
separates into tallow.
"This fat," Tyler says, "it has a lot of salt so the more water, the better."
Put the fat in the water, and get the water boiling.
Tyler squeezes the white mess from each sandwich bag into the water, and
then Tyler buries the empty bags all the way at the bottom of the trash.
Tyler says, "Use a little imagination. Remember all that pioneer shit they
taught you in Boy Scouts. Remember your high school chemistry."
It's hard to imagine Tyler in Boy Scouts.
Another thing I could do, Tyler tells me, is I could drive to my boss's
house some night and hook a hose up to an outdoor spigot. hook the hose
to a hand pump, and I could inject the house plumbing with a charge of
industrial dye. Red or blue or green, and wait to see how my boss looks
the next day. Or, I could just sit in the bushes and pump the hand pump
until the plumbing was superpressurized to 110 psi. This way, when
someone goes to flush a toilet, the toilet tank will explode. At 150 psi, if
someone turns on the shower, the water pressure will blow off the shower
head, strip the threads, blam, the shower head turns into a mortar shell.
Tyler only says this to make me feel better. The truth is I like my boss.
Besides, I'm enlightened now. You know, only Buddha-style behavior.
Spider chrysanthemums. The Diamond Sutra and the Blue Cliff Record.
Hari Rama, you know, Krishna, Krishna. You know, Enlightened.
"Sticking feathers up your butt," Tyler says, "does not make you a
chicken."
As the fat renders, the tallow will float to the surface of the boiling water.
Oh, I say, so I'm sticking feathers up my butt.
