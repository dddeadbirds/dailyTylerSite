Chapter 22
THAT OLD SAYING, about how you always kill the thing you love,
well, it works both ways.
And it does work both ways.
This morning I went to work and there were police barricades between the
building and the parking lot with the police at the front doors, taking
statements from the people I work with. Everybody milling around.
I didn't even get off the bus.
I am Joe's Cold Sweat.
From the bus, I can see the floor-to-ceiling windows on the third floor of
my office building are blown out, and inside a fireman in a dirty yellow
slicker is whacking at a burnt panel in the suspended ceiling. A
smoldering desk inches out the broken window, pushed by two firemen,
then the desk tilts and slides and falls the quick three stories to the
sidewalk and lands with more of a feeling than a sound.
Breaks open and it's still smoking.'
I am the Pit of Joe's Stomach.
It's my desk.
I know my boss is dead.
The three ways to make napalm. I knew Tyler was going to kill my boss.
The second I smelled gasoline on my hands, when I said I wanted out of
my job, I was giving him permission. Be my guest.
Kill my boss.
Oh, Tyler.
I know a computer blew up.
I know this because Tyler knows this.
I don't want to know this, but you use a jeweler's drill to drill a hole
through the top of a computer monitor. All the space monkeys know this. I
typed up Tyler's notes. This is a new version of the lightbulb bomb, where
you drill a hole in a lightbulb and fill the bulb with gasoline. Plug the hole
with wax or silicone, then screw the bulb into a socket and let someone
walk into the room and throw the switch.
A computer tube can hold a lot more gasoline than a lightbulb.
