Tyler pries the lid off the can of lye. "You can blow up bridges," Tyler
says.
"You can mix the nitroglycerin with more nitric acid and paraffin and
make gelatin explosives," Tyler says.
"You could blow up a building, easy," Tyler says.
Tyler tilts the can of lye an inch above the shining wet kiss on the back of
my hand.
"This is a chemical burn," Tyler says, "and it will hurt worse than you've
ever been burned. Worse than a hundred cigarettes."
The kiss shines on the back of my hand.
"You'll have a scar," Tyler says.
"With enough soap," Tyler says, "you could blow up the whole world.
Now remember your promise."
And Tyler pours the lye.
