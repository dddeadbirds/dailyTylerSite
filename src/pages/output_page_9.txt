All this dying had started with Chloe being a little tired, and now Chloe
was too bored to go in for treatment. Pornographic movies, she had
pornographic movies at home in her apartment.
During the French Revolution, Chloe told me, the women in prison, the
duchesses, baronesses, marquises, whatever, they would screw any man
who'd climb on top. Chloe breathed against my neck. Climb on top. Pony
up, did I know. Screwing passed the time.
La petite mort, the French called it.
Chloe had pornographic movies, if I was interested. Amyl nitrate.
Lubricants.
Normal times, I'd be sporting an erection. Our Chloe, however, is a
skeleton dipped in yellow wax.
Chloe looking the way she is, I am nothing. Not even nothing. Still,
Chloe's shoulder pokes mine when we sit around a circle on the shag
carpet. We close our eyes. This was Chloe's turn to lead us in guided
meditation, and she talked us into the garden of serenity. Chloe talked us
up the hill to the palace of seven doors. Inside the palace were the seven
doors, the green door, the yellow door, the orange door, and Chloe talked
us through opening each door, the blue door, the red door, the white door,
and finding what was there.
Eyes closed, we imagined our pain as a ball of white healing light floating
around our feet and rising to our knees, our waist, our chest. Our chakras
opening. The heart chakra. The head chakra. Chloe talked us into caves
where we met our power animal. Mine was a penguin.
Ice covered the floor of the cave, and the penguin said, slide. Without any
effort, we slid through tunnels and galleries.
Then it was time to hug.
Open your eyes.
This was therapeutic physical contact, Chloe said. We should all choose a
partner. Chloe threw herself around my head and cried. She had strapless
underwear at home, and cried. Chloe had oils and handcuffs, and cried as I
watched the second hand on my watch go around eleven times.
So I didn't cry at my first support group, two years ago. I didn't cry at my
second or my third support group, either. I didn't cry at blood parasites or
bowel cancers or organic brain dementia.
