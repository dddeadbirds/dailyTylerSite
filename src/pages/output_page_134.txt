"Good evening, sir."
Right now, I can imagine him calling some Project Mayhem headquarters
and reporting my whereabouts. They'll have a wall map of the city and
trace my movements with little pushpins. I feel tagged like a migrating
goose on Wild Kingdom.
They're all spying on me, keeping tabs.
"You can take all six of these and not get sick to your stomach," Marla
says, "but you have to take them by putting them up your butt."
Oh, this is pleasant.
Marla says, "I'm not making this up. We can get something stronger, later.
Some real drugs like cross tops or black beauties or alligators."
I'm not putting these pills up my ass.
"Then only take two."
Where are we going to go?
"Bowling. It's open all night, and they won't let you sleep there."
Everywhere we go, I say, guys on the street think I'm Tyler burden.
"Is that why the bus driver let us ride for free?"
Yeah. And that's why the two guys on the bus gave us their seats.
"So what's your point?"
I don't think it's enough to just hide out. We have to do something to get
rid of Tyler.
"I dated a guy once who liked to wear my clothes," Marla says. "You
know, dresses. Hats with veils. We could dress you up and sneak you
around."
I'm not cross-dressing, and I'm not putting pills up my ass.
"It gets worse," Marla says. "I dated a guy, once, who wanted me to fake a
lesbian scene with his blow-up doll."
I could imagine myself becoming one of Marla's stories.
I dated a guy once who was a split personality
"I dated this other guy who used one of those penis enlargement systems."
I ask what time is it?
"Four A.M."
In another three hours, I have to be at work.
