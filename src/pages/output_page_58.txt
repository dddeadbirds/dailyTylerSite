Chapter 8

IN SOUTH AMERICA, Land of Enchantment, we could be wading in a
river where tiny fish will swim up Tyler's urethra. The fish have barbed
spines that flare out and back so once they're up Tyler, the fish set up
housekeeping and get ready to lay their eggs. In so many ways, how we
spent Saturday night could be worse.
"It could've been worse," Tyler says, "what we did with Marla's mother."
I say, shut up.
Tyler says, the French government could've taken us to an underground
complex outside of Paris where not even surgeons but semiskilled
technicians would razor our eyelids off as part of toxicity testing an
aerosol tanning spray.
"This stuff happens," Tyler says. "Read the newspaper."
What's worse is I knew what Tyler had been up to with Marla's mother,
but for the first time since I've known him, Tyler had some oval play
money. Tyler was making real bucks. Nordstrom's called and left an order
for two hundred bars of Tyler's brown sugar facial soap before Christmas.
At twenty bucks a bar, suggested retail price, we had money to go out on
Saturday night. Money to fix the leak in the gas line. Go dancing. Without
money to worry about, maybe I could quit my job.
Tyler calls himself the Paper Street Soap Company. People are saying it's
the best soap ever.
"What would've been worse," Tyler says, "is if you had accidentally eaten
Marla's mother."
Through a mouthful of Kung Pao Chicken, I say to just shut the hell up.
Where we are this Saturday night is the front seat of a 1968 Impala sitting
on two flats in the front row of a used-car lot. Tyler and me, we're talking,
drinking beer out of cans, and the front seat of this Impala is bigger than
most people's sofas. The car lots up and down this part of the boulevard, in
the industry they call these lots the Pot Lots where the cars all cost around
two hundred dollars and during the day, the gypsy guys who run these lots
stand around in their plywood offices smoking long, thin cigars.
