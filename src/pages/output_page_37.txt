"If this is your first night at fight club," Tyler yells, "you have to fight."
Most guys are at fight club because of something they're too scared to
fight. After a few fights, you're afraid a lot less.
A lot of best friends meet for the first time at fight club. Now I go to
meetings or conferences and see faces at conference tables, accountants
and junior executives or attorneys with broken noses spreading out like an
eggplant under the edges of bandages or they have a couple stitches under

he's looking at me with half my face clean shaved and half a leering bruise
hidden in the dark. Blood shining on my lips. And maybe Walter's
thinking about a meatless, painfree potluck he went to last weekend or the
ozone or the Earth's desperate need to stop cruel product testing on
animals, but probably he's not.
