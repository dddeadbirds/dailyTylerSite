I'm reading Reader's Digest in the kitchen. I am totally nonplussed.
Marla yells, "Tyler. Can I come in? Are you home?"
I yell, Tyler's not home.
Marla yells, "Don't be mean."
By now, I'm at the front door. Marla's standing in the foyer with a Federal
Express overnight package, and says, "I needed to put something in your
freezer."
I dog her heels on the way to the kitchen, saying, no.
No.
No.
No.
She is not going to start keeping her junk in this house.
"But Pumpkin," Marla says, "I don't have a freezer at the hotel, and you
said I could."
No, I did not. The last thing I want is Marla moving in, one piece of crap
at a time.
Marla has her Federal Express package ripped open on the kitchen table,
and she lifts something white out of the Styrofoam packing peanuts and
shakes this white thing in my face. "This is not crap," she says. "This is
my mother you're talking about so just fuck off."
What Marla lifts out of the package, it's one of those sandwich bags of
white stuff that Tyler rendered for tallow to make soap.
"Things would've been worse," Tyler says, "if you'd accidentally eaten
what was in one of those sandwich bags. If you'd got up in the middle of
the night sometime, and squeezed out the white goo and added California
onion soup mix and eaten it as a dip with potato chips. Or broccoli."
More than anything in the world right then, while Marla and I were
standing in the kitchen, I didn't want Marla to open the freezer.
I asked, what was she going to do with the white stuff?
"Paris lips," Marla said. "As you get older, your lips pull inside your
mouth. I'm saving for a collagen lip injection. I have almost thirty pounds
of collagen in your freezer."
I asked, how big of lips did she want?
Marla said it was the operation itself that scared her.
