I know who you are. I know where you live. I'm keeping your license, and
I'm going to check on you, mister Raymond K. Hessel. In three months,
and then in six months, and then in a year, and if you aren't back in school
on your way to being a veterinarian, you will be dead.
You didn't say anything.
Get out of here, and do your little life, but remember I'm watching you,
Raymond Hessel, and I'd rather kill you than see you working a shit job
for just enough money to buy cheese and watch television.
Now, I'm going to walk away so don't turn around.
This is what Tyler wants me to do.
These are Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.
I am Tyler's mouth.
I am Tyler's hands.
Everybody in Project Mayhem is part of Tyler Durden, and vice versa.
Raymond K. K. Hessel, your dinner is going to taste better than any meal
you've ever eaten, and tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of your
entire life.
bar, they throw an arm around me and want to buy me a beer. It's like I
already know which bars are the fight club bars. I ask, have they seen a
guy named Tyler Durden. It's stupid to ask if they know about fight club.
The first rule is you don't talk about fight club. But have they seen Tyler
Durden? They say, never heard of him, sir. But you might find him in
Chicago, sir. It must be the hole in my cheek, everyone calls me sir. And
they wink. You wake up at O'Hare and take the shuttle into Chicago. Set
your watch ahead an hour.
