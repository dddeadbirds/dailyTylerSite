Now.
Soul clear of body.
Now.
Death commences.
Now.
Oh, this should be so sweet, the remembered warm jumble of Chloe still in
my arms and Chloe dead somewhere.
But no, I'm watched by Marla.
In guided meditation, I open my arms to receive my inner child, and the
child is Marla smoking her cigarette. No white healing ball of light. Liar.
No chakras. Picture your chakras opening as flowers and at the center of
each is a slow motion explosion of sweet light.
Liar.
My chakras stay closed.
When meditation ends, everyone is stretching and twisting their heads and
pulling each other to their feet in preparation. Therapeutic physical
contact. For the hug, I cross in three steps to stand against Marla who
looks up into my face as I watch everyone else for the cue.
Let's all, the cue comes, embrace someone near us.
My arms clamp around Marla.
Pick someone special to you, tonight.
Marla's cigarette hands are pinned to her waist.
Tell this someone how you feel.
Marla doesn't have testicular cancer. Marla doesn't have tuberculosis. She
isn't dying. Okay in that brainy brain-food philosophy way, we're all
dying, but Marla isn't dying the way Chloe was dying.
The cue comes, share yourself.
So, Marla, how do you like them apples?
Share yourself completely.
So, Marla, get out. Get out. Get out.
Go ahead and cry if you have to.
Marla stares up at me. Her eyes are brown. Her earlobes pucker around
earring holes, no earrings. Her chapped lips are frosted with dead skin.
Go ahead and cry.
"You're not dying either," Marla says.
