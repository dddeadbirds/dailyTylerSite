The J and R 68 semiautomatic carbine also takes a thirty-shot mag, and it
only weighs seven pounds.
My boss just looks at me.
It's scary, I say. This is probably somebody he's known for years. Probably
this guy knows all about him, where he lives, and where his wife works
and his kids go to school.
This is exhausting, and all of a sudden very, very boring.
And why does Tyler need ten copies of the fight club rules?
What I don't have to say is I know about the leather interiors that cause
birth defects. I know about the counterfeit brake linings that looked good
enough to pass the purchasing agent, but fail after two thousand miles.
I know about the air-conditioning rheostat that gets so hot it sets fire to the
maps in your glove compartment. I know how many people burn alive
because of fuel-injector flashback. I've seen people's legs cut off at the
knee when turbochargers start exploding and send their vanes through the
firewall and into the passenger compartment. I've been out in the field and
seen the burned-up cars and seen the reports where CAUSE OF FAILURE
is recorded as "unknown."

paper into a ball and toss it into the trash can next to my desk.
Maybe, I say, you shouldn't be bringing me every little piece of trash you

Sunday night, I go to Remaining Men Together and the basement of
Trinity Episcopal is almost empty. Just Big Bob, and I come dragging in
with every muscle bruised inside and out, but my heart's still racing and
my thoughts are a tornado in my head. This is insomnia. All night, your
thoughts are on the air.
All night long, you're thinking: Am I asleep? Have I slept?
Insult to injury, Big Bob's arms come out of his T-shirt sleeves quilted
with muscle and so hard they shine. Big Bob smiles, he's so happy to see
me.
He thought I was dead.
Yeah, I say, me too.
