"Saponification," Tyler says, "is the chemical reaction you need to make
good soap. Chicken fat won't work or any fat with too much salt.
"Listen," Tyler says. "We have a big order to fill. What we'll do is send
Marla's mom some chocolates and probably some fruitcakes."
I don't think that will work, anymore.
Long story short, Marla looked in the freezer. Okay, there was a little
scuffle, first. I try to stop her, and the bag she's holding gets dropped and
breaks open on the linoleum and we both slip in the greasy white mess and
come up gagging. I have Marla around the waist from behind, her black
hair whipping my face, her arms pinned to her sides, and I'm saying over
and over, it wasn't me. It wasn't me.
I didn't do it.
"My mother! You're spilling her all over!"
We needed to make soap, I say with my face pressed up behind her car.
We needed to wash my pants, to pay the rent, to fix the leak in the gas
line. It wasn't me.
It was Tyler.
Marla screams, "What are you talking about?" and twists out of her skirt.
I'm scrambling to get up off the greased floor with an armful of Marla's
India cotton print skirt, and Marla in her panties and wedgie Feels and
peasant blouse throws open the freezer part of the fridge, and inside there's
no collagen trust fund.
There's two old flashlight batteries, but that's all.
"Where is she?"
I'm already crawling backwards, my hands slipping, my shoes slipping on
the linoleum, and my ass wiping a clean path across the dirty Moor away
from Marla and the fridge. I hold up the skirt so I don't Dave to see
Marla's face when I tell her.
The truth.
We made soap out of it. Her. Marla's mother.
"Soap?"
Soap. You boil fat. You mix it with lye. You get soap.
When Marla screams, I throw the skirt in her face and run. I slip. I run.
Around and around the first floor, Marla runs after me, skidding m the
corners, pushing off against the window casings for momentum. Slipping.
