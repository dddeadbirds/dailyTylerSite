Nobody asked anything. You don't ask questions is the first rule in Project
Mayhem.
Tyler handed the gun around. It was so heavy for something se small, as if
a giant thing like a mountain or a sun were collapsed and melted down to
make this. The committee guys held it by two fingers. Everyone wanted to
ask if it was loaded, but the second rule of Project Mayhem is you don't
ask questions.
Maybe it was loaded, maybe not. Maybe we should always assume the
worst.
"A gun," Tyler said, "is simple and perfect. You just draw the trigger
back."
The third rule in Project Mayhem is no excuses.
"The trigger," Tyler said, "frees the hammer, and the hammer strikes the
powder."
The fourth rule is no lies.
"The explosion blasts a metal slug off the open end of the shell, and the
barrel of the gun focuses the exploding powder and the rocketing slug,"
Tyler said, "like a man out of a cannon, like a missile out of a silo, like
your jism, in one direction."
When Tyler invented Project Mayhem, Tyler said the goal of Project
Mayhem had nothing to do with other people. Tyler didn't care if other
people got hurt or not. The goal was to teach each man in the project that
he had the power to control history. We, each of us, can take control of the
world.
It was at fight club that Tyler invented Project Mayhem.
I tagged a first-timer one night at fight club. That Saturday night, a young
guy with an angel's face came to his first fight club, and I tagged him for a
fight. That's the rule. If it's your first night in fight club, you have to fight.
I knew that so I tagged him because the insomnia was on again, and I was
in a mood to destroy something beautiful.
Since most of my face never gets a chance to heal, I've got nothing to lose
in the looks department. My boss, at work, he asked me what I was doing
about the hole through my cheek that never heals. When I drink coffee, I
told him, I put two fingers over the hole so it won't leak.
