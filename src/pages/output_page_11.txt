This is better than real life.
Fast-forward, Bob said, to the cancer. Then he was bankrupt. He had two
grown kids who wouldn't return his calls.
The cure for bitch tits was for the doctor to cut up under the pectorals and
drain any fluid.
This was all I remember because then Bob was closing in around me with
his arms, and his head was folding down to cover me. Then I was lost
inside oblivion, dark and silent and complete, and when I finally stepped
away from his soft chest, the front of Bob's shirt was a wet mask of how I
looked crying.
That was two years ago, at my first night with Remaining Men Together.
At almost every meeting since then, Big Bob has made me cry.
I never went back to the doctor. I never chewed the valerian root.
This was freedom. Losing all hope was freedom. If I didn't say anything,
people in a group assumed the worst. They cried harder. I cried harder.
Look up into the stars and you're gone.
Walking home after a support group, I felt more alive than I'd ever felt. I
wasn't host to cancer or blood parasites; I was the little warm center that
the life of the world crowded around.
And I slept. Babies don't sleep this well.
Every evening, I died, and every evening, I was born.
Resurrected.
Until tonight, two years of success until tonight, because I can't cry with
this woman watching me. Because I can't hit bottom, I can't be saved. My
tongue thinks it has flocked wallpaper, I'm biting the inside of my mouth
so much. I haven't slept in four days.
With her watching, I'm a liar. She's a fake. She's the liar. At the
introductions tonight, we introduced ourselves: I'm Bob, I'm Paul, I'm
Terry, I'm David.
I never give my real name.
"'This is cancer, right?" she said.
Then she said, "Well, hi, I'm Marla Singer."
Nobody ever told Marla what kind of cancer. Then we were all busy
cradling our inner child.
