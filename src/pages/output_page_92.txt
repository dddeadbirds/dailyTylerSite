The guy on the porch is mister angel face whom I tried to destroy the night
Tyler invented Project Mayhem. Even with his two black eyes and blond
crew cut, you see his tough pretty scowl without wrinkles or scars. Put
him in a dress and make him smile, and he'd be a woman. Mister angel
just stands his toes against the front door, just looks straight ahead into the
splintering wood with his hands at his sides, wearing black shoes, black
shirt, black pair of trousers.
"Get rid of him," Tyler tells me. "He's too young."
I ask how young is too young?
"It doesn't matter," Tyler says. "If the applicant is young, we tell him he's
too young. If he's fat, he's too fat. If he's old, he's too old.
Thin, he's too thin. White, he's too white. Black, he's too black."
This is how Buddhist temples have tested applicants going back for
bahzillion years, Tyler says. You tell the applicant to go away, and if his
resolve is so strong that he waits at the entrance without food or shelter or
encouragement for three days, then and only then can he enter and begin
the training.
So I tell mister angel he's too young, but at lunchtime he's still there. After
lunch, I go out and beat mister angel with a broom and kick the guy's sack
out into the street. From upstairs, Tyler watches me stickball the broom
upside the kid's ear, the kid just standing there, then I kick his stuff into
the gutter and scream.
Go away, I'm screaming. Haven't you heard? You're too young. You'll
never make it, I scream. Come back in a couple years and apply again.
Just go. Just get off my porch.
The next day, the guy is still there, and Tyler goes out to go, "I'm sorry."
Tyler says he's sorry he told the guy about training, but the guy is really
too young, and would he please just go.
Good cop. Bad cop.
I scream at the poor guy, again. Then, six hours later, Tyler goes out and
says he's sorry, but no. The guy has to leave. Tyler says he's going to call
the police if the guy won't leave.
And the guy stays.
And his clothes are still in the gutter. The wind takes the torn paper sack
away.
