"Let us help you! Miss Singer, you have every reason to live! Just let us
in, Marla, and we can help you with your problems!"
Marla and Tyler rushed out into the street. Tyler got Marla into a cab, and
high up on the eighth floor of the hotel, Tyler could see shadows moving
back and forth across the windows of Marla's room.
Out on the freeway with all the lights and the other cars, six lanes of traffic
racing toward the vanishing point, Marla tells Tyler he has to
keep her up all night. If Marla ever falls asleep, she'll die.
A lot of people wanted Marla dead, she told Tyler. These people were
already dead and on the other side, and at night they called on the
telephone. Marla would go to bars and hear the bartender calling her
name, and when she took the call, the line was dead.
Tyler and Marla, they were up almost all night in the room next to mine.
When Tyler woke up, Marla had disappeared back to the Regent Hotel.
I tell Tyler, Marla Singer doesn't need a lover, she needs a case worker.
Tyler says, "Don't call this love."
Long story short, now Marla's out to ruin another part of my life. Ever
since college, I make friends. They get married. I lose friends.
Fine.
Neat, I say.
Tyler asks, is this a problem for me?
I am Joe's Clenching Bowels.
No, I say, it's fine.
Put a gun to my head and paint the wall with my brains.
Just great, I say. Really.
M Y B O S S S E N D S me home because of all the dried blood on my
pants, and I am overjoyed.
The hole punched through my cheek doesn't ever heal. I'm going to work,
and my punched-out eye sockets are two swollen-up black bagels around
the little piss holes I have left to see through. Until today, it really pissed
me off that I'd become this totally centered Zen Master and nobody had
noticed. Still, I'm doing the little FAX thing. I write little HAIKU things
and FAX them around to everyone. When I pass people in the hall at
work, I get totally ZEN right in everyone's hostile little FACE.
