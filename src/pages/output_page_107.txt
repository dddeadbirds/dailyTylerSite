I am nothing, and not even that.
Cold.
Invisible.
I smell leather. My seat belt feels twisted like a straitjacket around me, and
when I try to sit up, I hit my head against the steering wheel. This hurts
more than it should. My head is resting in the mechanic's lap, and as I look
up, my eyes adjust to see the mechanic's face high over me, smiling,
driving, and I can see stars outside the driver's window.
My hands and face are sticky with something.
Blood?
Buttercream frosting.
The mechanic looks down. "Happy Birthday."
I smell smoke and remember the birthday cake.
"I almost broke the steering wheel with your head," he says.
Just nothing else, just the night air and the smell of smoke, and the stars
and the mechanic smiling and driving, my head in his lap, all of a sudden I
don't feel like I have to sit up.
Where's the cake?
The mechanic says, "On the floor."
Just the night air and the smell of smoke is heavier.
Did I get my wish?
Up above me, outlined against the stars in the window, the face smiles.
"Those birthday candles," he says, "they're the kind that never go out."
In the starlight, my eyes adjust enough to see smoke braiding up from little
fires all around us in the carpet.
