We're down to our last ten minutes.
The Parker-Morris Building won't be here in ten minutes. I know this
because Tyler knows this.
The barrel of the gun pressed against the back of my throat, Tyler says,
"We won't really die."
I tongue the gun barrel into my surviving cheek and say, Tyler, you're
thinking of vampires.
We're down to our last eight minutes.
The gun is just in case the police helicopters get here sooner.
To God, this looks like one man alone, holding a gun in his own mouth,
but it's Tyler holding the gun, and it's my life.
You take a 98-percent concentration of fuming nitric acid and add the acid
to three times that amount of sulfuric acid.
You have nitroglycerin.
Seven minutes.
Mix the vitro with sawdust, and you have a nice plastic explosive. A lot of
the space monkeys mix their vitro with cotton and add Epsom salts as a
sulfate. This works, too. Some monkeys, they use paraffin mixed with
vitro. Paraffin has never, ever worked for me.
Four minutes.
Tyler and me at the edge of the roof, the gun in my mouth, I'm wondering
how clean this gun is.
Three minutes.
Then somebody yells.
"Wait," and it's Marla coming toward us across the roof.
Marla's coming toward me, just me because Tyler's gone. Poor. Tyler's my
hallucination, not hers. Fast as a magic trick, Tyler's disappeared. And
now I'm just one man holding a gun in my mouth.
"We followed you," Marla yells. "All the people from the support group.
You don't have to do this. Put the gun down."
Behind Marla, all the bowel cancers, the brain parasites, the melanoma
people, the tuberculosis people are walking, limping, wheelchairing
toward me.
They're saying, "Wait."
Their voices come to me on the cold wind, saying, "Stop."
