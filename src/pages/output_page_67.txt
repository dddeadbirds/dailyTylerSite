What I would do, I say, is I'd be very careful who I talked to about this
paper.
I say, it sounds like some dangerous psychotic killer wrote this, and this
buttoned-down schizophrenic could probably go over the edge at any
moment in the working day and stalk from office to office with an
Armalite AR-180 carbine gas-operated semiautomatic.
My boss just looks at me.
The guy, I say, is probably at home every night with a little rattail file,
filing a cross into the tip of every one of his rounds. This way, when he
shows up to work one morning and pumps a round into his nagging,
ineffectual, petty, whining, butt-sucking, candy-ass boss, that one round
will split along the filed grooves and spread open the way a dumdum
bullet flowers inside you to blow a bushel load of your stinking guts out
through your spine. Picture your gut chakra opening in a slow-motion
explosion of sausage-casing small intestine.
My boss takes the paper out from under my nose.
Go ahead, I say, read some more.
No really, I say, it sounds fascinating. The work of a totally diseased
mind.
And I smile. The little butthole-looking edges of the hole in my cheek are
the same blue-black as .a dog's gums. The skin stretched tight across the
swelling around my eyes feels varnished.
My boss just looks at me.
Let me help you, I say.
I say, the fourth rule of fight club is one fight at a time.
My boss looks at the rules and then looks at me.
I say, the fifth rule is no shoes, no shirts in the fight.
My boss looks at the rules and looks at me.
Maybe, I say, this totally diseased fuck would use an Eagle Apache
carbine because an Apache takes a thirty-shot mag and only weighs nine
pounds. The Armalite only takes a five-round magazine. With thirty shots,
our totally fucked hero could go the length of mahogany row and take out
every vice president with a cartridge left over for each director.
Tyler's words coming out of my mouth. I used to be such a nice person.
I just look at my boss. My boss has blue; blue, pale cornflower blue eyes.
