Tyler's kiss.
"Everybody knows about the birthmark," the bartender says. "It's part of
the legend. You're turning into a fucking legend, man."
I call Marla from my Seattle motel room to ask if we've ever done it. You
know. Long distance, Marla says, "What?" Slept together. "What!" Have I
ever, you know, had sex with her? "Christ!" Well? "Well?" she says. Have
we ever had sex? "You are such a piece of shit." Have we had sex? "I
could kill you!" Is that a yes or a no? "I knew this would happen," Marla
says. "You're such a flake. You love me. You ignore me. You save my
life, then you cook my mother into soap."
I pinch myself.
I ask Marla how me met.
"In that testicle cancer thing," Marla says. "Then you saved my life." I
saved her life?
"You saved my life."
Tyler saved her life.
"You saved my life."
I stick my finger through the hole in my cheek and wiggle the finger
around. This should be good for enough major league pain to wake me up.
Marla says, "You saved my life. The Regent Hotel. I'd accidentally
attempted suicide. Remember?"
Oh.
"That night," Marla says, "I said I wanted to have your abortion." We've
just lost cabin pressure.
I ask Marla what my name is.
We're all going to die.
Marla says, "Tyler Durden. Your name is Tyler Butt-Wipe-for-Brains
Durden. You live at 5123 NE Paper Street which is currently teeming with
your little disciples shaving their heads and burning their skin off with
lye."
I've got to get some sleep.
"You've got to get your ass back here," Marla yells over the phone,
"before those little trolls make soap out of me."
I've got to find Tyler.
