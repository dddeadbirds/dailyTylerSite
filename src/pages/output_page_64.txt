Leaving filthy handprints of grease and floor dirt among the wallpaper
flowers. Falling and sliding into the wainscoting, getting back up, running.
Marla screaming, "You boiled my mother!"
Tyler boiled her mother.
Marla screaming, always one swipe of her fingernails behind me.
Tyler boiled her mother.
"You boiled my mother!"
The front door was still open.
And then I was out the front door with Marla screaming in the doorway
behind me. My feet didn't slip against the concrete sidewalk, and I just
kept running. Until I found Tyler or until Tyler found me, and I told him
what happened.
With one beer each, Tyler and I spread out on the front and back seats
with me in the front seat. Even now, Marla's probably still in the house,
throwing magazines against the walls and screaming how I'm a prick and a
monster twofaced capitalist suck-ass bastard. The miles of night between
Marla and me offer insects and melanomas and flesh-eating viruses.
Where I'm at isn't so bad.
"When a man is hit by lightning," Tyler says, "his head burns down to a
smoldering baseball and his zipper welds itself shut."
I say, did we hit bottom, tonight?
Tyler lies back and asks, "If Marilyn Monroe was alive right now, what
would she be doing?"
I say, goodnight.
The headliner hangs down in shreds from the ceiling, and Tyler says,
"Clawing at the lid of her coffin."
