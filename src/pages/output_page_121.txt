Three space monkeys were on lookout.
One space monkey did the ether.
One space monkey tugged down his esteemed sweatpants.
The dog is a spaniel, and it's just barking and barking.
Barking and barking.
Barking and barking.
One space monkey wrapped the rubber band three times until it was tight
around the top of his esteemed sack.
"One monkey's between his legs with the knife," Tyler whispers with his
punched-out face by my ear. "And I'm whispering in his most esteemed
police commissioner's ear that he better stop the fight club crackdown, or
we'll tell the world that his esteemed honor does not have any balls."
Tyler whispers, "How far do you think you'll get, your honor?"
The rubber band is cutting off any feeling down there.
"How far do you think you'll get in politics if the voters know you have no
nuts?"
By now, his honor has lost all feeling.
Man, his nuts are ice cold.
If even one fight club has to close, we'll send his nuts east and west. One
goes to the New York Tuner and one goes to the Los Angeles Timer. One
to each. Sort of press release style.
The space monkey took the ether rag off his mouth, and the commissioner
said, don't.
And Tyler said, "We have nothing to lose except fight club."
The commissioner, he had everything.
All we were left was the shit and the trash of the world.
Tyler nodded to the space monkey with the knife between the
commissioner's legs.
Tyler asked, "Imagine the rest of your life with your bag flapping empty."
The commissioner said, no.
And don't.
Stop.
Please.
Oh.
God.
