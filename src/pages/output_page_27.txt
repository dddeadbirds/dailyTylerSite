announcement said my name. Would I please meet with an airline
representative waiting at the gate.
I set my watch back three hours, and it was still after midnight.
There was the airline representative at the gate, and there was the security
task force guy to say, ha, your electric razor kept your checked baggage at
Dulles. The task force guy called the baggage handlers Throwers. Then he
called them Rampers. To prove things could be worse, the guy told me at
least it wasn't a dildo. Then, maybe because I'm a guy and he's a guy and
it's one o'clock in the morning, maybe to make me laugh, the guy said
industry slang for flight attendant was Space Waitress. Or Air Mattress. It
looked like the guy was wearing a pilot's uniform, white shirt with little
epaulets and a blue tie. My luggage had been cleared, he said, and would
arrive the next day.
The security guy asked my name and address and phone number, and then
he asked me what was the difference between a condom and a cockpit.
"You can only get one prick into a condom," he said.
I cabbed home on my last ten bucks.
The local police had been asking a lot of questions, too.
My electric razor, which wasn't a bomb, was still three time zones behind
me.
Something which was a bomb, a big bomb, had blasted my clever
Njurunda coffee tables in the shape of a lime green yin and an orange yang
that fit together to make a circle. Well they were splinters, now.
My Haparanda sofa group with the orange slip covers, design by Erika
Pekkari, it was trash, now.
And I wasn't the only slave to my nesting instinct. The people I know who
used to sit in the bathroom with pornography, now they sit in the bathroom
with their IKEA furniture catalogue.
We all have the same Johanneshov armchair in the Strinne green stripe
pattern. Mine fell fifteen stories, burning, into a fountain.
We all have the same Rislampa/Har paper lamps made from wire and
environmentally friendly unbleached paper. Mine are confetti.
All that sitting in the bathroom.
The Alle cutlery service. Stainless steel. Dishwasher safe.
The Vild hall clock made of galvanized steel, oh, I had to have that.
