Oh, not my refrigerator. I'd collected shelves full of different mustards,
some stone-ground, some English pub style. There were fourteen different
flavors of fat-free salad dressing, and seven kinds of capers.
I know, I know, a house full of condiments and no real food.
The doorman blew his nose and something went into his handkerchief
with the good slap of a pitch into a catcher's mitt.
You could go up to the fifteen floor, the doorman said, but nobody could
go into the unit. Police orders. The police had been asking, did I have an
old girlfriend who'd want to do this or did I make an enemy of somebody
who had access to dynamite.
"It wasn't worth going up," the doorman said. "All that's left is the
concrete shell."
The police hadn't ruled out arson. No one had smelled gas. The doorman
raises an eyebrow. This guy spent his time flirting with the day maids and
nurses who worked in the big units on the top floor and waited in the
lobby chairs for their rides after work. Three years I lived here, and the
doorman still sat reading his Ellery Queen magazine every night while I
shifted packages and bags to unlock the front door and let myself in.
The doorman raises an eyebrow and says how some people will go on a
long trip and leave a candle, a long, long candle burning in a big puddle of
gasoline. People with financial difficulties do this stuff. People who want
out from under.
I asked to use the lobby phone.
"A lot of young people try to impress the world and buy too many things,"
the doorman said.
I called Tyler.
The phone rang in Tyler's rented house on Paper Street.
Oh, Tyler, please deliver me.
And the phone rang.
The doorman leaned into my shoulder and said, "A lot of young people
don't know what they really want."
Oh, Tyler, please rescue me.
And the phone rang.
"Young people, they think they want the whole world."
Deliver me from Swedish furniture.
