Testes.
Huevos.
Picture the best part of yourself frozen in a sandwich bag at the Paper
Street Soap Company.
"You know it's useless to fight us," the mechanic says.
The bus driver chews his sandwich and watches us in the overhead mirror.
A police siren wails, coming closer. A tractor rattles across a field in the
distance. Birds. A window in the back of the bus is half open. Clouds.
Weeds grow at the edge of the gravel turnaround. Bees or flies buzz
around the weeds.
"We're just after a little collateral," the fight club mechanic says. "This
isn't just a threat, this time, Mr. Durden. This time, we have to cut them."
The bus driver says, "It's cops."
The siren arrives somewhere at the front of the bus.
So what do I have to fight back with?
A police car pulls up to the bus, lights flashing blue and red through the
bus windshield, and someone outside the bus is shouting, "Hold up in
there."
And I'm saved.
Sort of.
I can tell the cops about Tyler. I'll tell them everything about fight club,
and maybe I'll go to jail, and then Project Mayhem will be their problem to
solve, and I won't be staring down a knife.
The cops come up the bus steps, the first cop saying, "You cut him yet?"
The second cop says, "Do it quick, there's a warrant out for his arrest."
Then he takes off his hat, and to me he says, "Nothing personal, Mr.
Durden. It's a pleasure to finally meet you."
I say, you all are making a big mistake.
The mechanic says, "You told us you'd probably say that."
I'm not Tyler Durden.
"You told us you'd say that, too."
I'm changing the rules. You can still have fight club, but we're not going to
castrate anyone, anymore.
