Open your eyes.
We should all choose a partner.
Marla crosses the room in three quick steps and slaps me hard across the
face.
Share yourself completely.
"You fucking suck-ass piece of shit," Marla says.
Around us, everyone stands staring.
Then both of Marla's fists are beating me from every direction. "You
killed someone," she's screaming. "I called the police and they should be
here any minute."
I grab her wrists and say, maybe the police will come, but probably they
won't.
Marla twists and says the police are speeding over here to hook me up to
the electric chair and bake my eyes out or at least give me a lethal
injection.
This will feel just like a bee sting.
An overdose shot of sodium phenobarbital, and then the big sleep. Valley

Marla says she saw me kill somebody today.
If she means my boss, I say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, the police
know, everyone's looking for me to lethally inject me, already, but it was
Tyler who killed my boss.
Tyler and I just happen to have the same fingerprints, but no one
understands.
"You can suck shit," Marla says and pushes her punched-out black eye at
me. "Just because you and your little disciples like getting beat up, you
touch me ever again, and you're dead."
"I saw you shoot a man tonight," Marla says.
No, it was a bomb, I say, and it happened this morning. Tyler drilled a
computer monitor and filled it with gasoline or black powder.
All the people with real bowel cancers are standing around watching this.
"No," Marla says. "I followed you to the Pressman Hotel, and you were a
waiter at one of those murder mystery parties."
The murder mystery parties, rich people would come to the hotel for a big
dinner party, and act out a sort of Agatha Christie story. Sometime
