Chapter 15
THIS FRIDAY NIGHT, I fall asleep at my desk at work.
When I wake up with my face and my crossed arms an my desktop, the
telephone is ringing, and everyone else is gone. A telephony was ringing
in my dream, and it's not clear if reality slipped into my dream or if my
dream is slopping over into reality.
I answer the phone, Compliance and Liability. That's my department.
Compliance and Liability.
The sun is going down, and piled-up storm clouds the size of Wyoming
and Japan are headed our way. It's not like I have a window at work. All
the outside walls are floor-to-ceiling glass. Everything where I work is
floor-toceiling glass. Everything is vertical blinds. Everything is industrial
low-pile gray carpet spotted with little tombstone monuments where the
PCs plug into the network. Everything is a maze of cubicles boxed in with
fences of upholstered plywood.
A vacuum cleaner hums somewhere.
My boss is gone on vacation. He sent me an E-mail and then disappeared.
I'm to prepare for a formal review in two weeks. Reserve a conference
room. Get all my ducks in a row. Update my resume That sort of thing.
They're building a case against me.
I am Joe's Complete Lack of Surprise.
I've been behaving miserably.
I pick up the phone, and it's Tyler, and he says, "Go outside, there's some
guys waiting for you in the parking lot."
I ask, who are they?
"They're all waiting," Tyler says.
I smell gasoline on my hands.
Tyler goes, "Hit the road. They have a car, outside. They have a Cadillac."
I'm still asleep.
Here, I'm not sure if Tyler is my dream.
Or if I am Tyler's dream.
I sniff the gasoline on my hands. There's nobody else around, and I get up
and walk out to the parking lot.
