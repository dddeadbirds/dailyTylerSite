A space monkey in the back seat picks it up: "You're not your problems."
The mechanic yells, "You're not your problems."
A space monkey shouts, "You're not your age."
The mechanic yells, "You're not your age."
Here, the mechanic swerves us into the oncoming lane, filling the car with
headlights through the windshield, cool as ducking jabs. One car and then
another comes at us head-on screaming its horn and the mechanic swerves
just enough to miss each one.
Headlights come at us, bigger and bigger, horns screaming, and the
mechanic cranes forward into the glare and noise and screams, "You ;ire
not your hopes."
No one takes up the yell.
This time, the car coming head-on swerves in time to save us.
Another car comes on, headlights blinking high, low, high, low, horn
blaring, and the mechanic screams, "You will not be saved."
The mechanic doesn't swerve, but the head-on car swerves.
Another car, and the mechanic screams, "We are all going to die,
someday."
This time, the oncoming car swerves, but the mechanic swerves hack into
its path. The car swerves, and the mechanic matches it, headon, again.
You melt and swell at that moment. For that moment, nothing matters.
Look up at the stars and you're gone. Not your luggage. Nothing matters.
Not your bad breath. The windows are dark outside and the horns are
blaring around you. The headlights are flashing high and low and high in
your face, and you will never have to go to work again.
You will never have to get another haircut.
"Quick," the mechanic says.
The car swerves again, and the mechanic swerves back into its path.
"What," he says, "what will you wish you'd done before you died?"
With the oncoming car screaming its horn and the mechanic so cool he
even looks away to look at me beside him in the front seat, and he says,
"Ten seconds to impact.
"Nine.
"In eight.
"Seven.
