This is when I'd cry because right now, your life comes down to nothing,
and not even nothing, oblivion.
Too much estrogen, and you get bitch tits.
It's easy to cry when you realize that everyone you love will reject you or
die. On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone will drop to
zero.
Bob loves me because he thinks my testicles were removed, too.
Around us in the Trinity Episcopal basement with the thrift store plaid
sofas are maybe twenty men and only one woman, all of them clung
together in pairs, most of them crying. Some pairs lean forward, heads
pressed ear-to-ear, the way wrestlers stand, locked. The man with the only
woman plants his elbows on her shoulders; one elbow on either side of her
head, her head between his hands, and his face crying against her neck.
The woman's face twists off to one side and her hand brings up a cigarette.
I peek out from under the armpit of Big Bob.
"All my life," Bob cries. "Why I do anything, I don't know."
The only woman here at Remaining Men Together, the testicular cancer
support group, this woman smokes her cigarette under the burden of a
stranger, and her eyes come together with mine.
Faker.
Faker.
Faker.
Short matte black hair, big eyes the way they are in Japanese animation,
skim milk thin, buttermilk sallow in her dress with a wallpaper pattern of
dark roses, this woman was also in my tuberculosis support group Friday
night. She was in my melanoma round table Wednesday night. Monday
night she was in my Firm Believers leukemia rap group. The part down
the center of her hair is a crooked lightning bolt of white scalp.
When you look for these support groups, they all have vague upbeat
names. My Thursday evening group for blood parasites, it's called Free
and Clear.
The group I go to for brain parasites is called Above and Beyond.
And Sunday afternoon at Remaining Men Together in the basement of
Trinity Episcopal, this woman is here, again.
Worse than that, I can't cry with her watching.
