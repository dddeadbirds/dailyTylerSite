Chapter 2
BOB'S BIG ARMS were closed around to hold me inside, and I was
squeezed in the dark between Bob's new sweating tits that hang enormous,
the way we think of God's as big. Going around the church basement full
of men, each night we met: this is Art, this is Paul, this is Bob; Bob's big
shoulders made me think of the horizon. Bob's thick blond hair was what
you get when hair cream calls itself sculpting mousse, so thick and blond
and the part is so straight.
His arms wrapped around me, Bob's hand palms my head against the new
tits sprouted on his barrel chest.
"It will be alright," Bob says. "You cry now."
From my knees to my forehead, I feel chemical reactions within Bob
burning food and oxygen.
"Maybe they got it all early enough," Bob says. "Maybe it's just
seminoma. With seminoma, you have almost a hundred percent survival
rate."
Bob's shoulders inhale themselves up in a long draw, then drop, drop, drop
in jerking sobs. Draw themselves up. Drop, drop, drop.
I've been coming here every week for two years, and every week Bob
wraps his arms around me, and I cry.
"You cry," Bob says and inhales and sob, sob, sobs. "Go on now and cry."
The big wet face settles down on top of my head, and I am lost inside.
This is when I'd cry. Crying is right at hand in the smothering dark, closed
inside someone else, when you see how everything you can ever
accomplish will end up as trash.
Anything you're ever proud of will be thrown away.
And I'm lost inside.
This is as close as I've been to sleeping in almost a week.
This is how I met Marla Singer.
Bob cries because six months ago, his testicles were removed. Then
hormone support therapy. Bob has tits because his testosterone ration is
too high. Raise the testosterone level too much, your body ups the
estrogen to seek a balance.
