Hello, I said, I've committed a terrible crime against humanity as part of a
political protest. My protest is over the exploitation of workers in the
service industry.
If I went to prison, I wouldn't be just an unbalanced peon diddling in the
soup. This would have heroic scale.
Robin Hood Waiter Champions Have-Nots.
This would be about a lot more than one hotel and one waiter.
The manager of the Pressman Hotel very gently took the receiver out of
my hand. The manager said he didn't want me working here anymore, not
the way I looked now.
I'm standing at the head of the manager's desk when I say, what?
You don't like the idea of third
And without flinching, still looking at the manager, I roundhouse the fist
at the centrifugal force end of my arm and slam fresh blood out of the
cracked scabs in my nose.
For no reason at all, I remember the night Tyler and I had our first fight. I
want you to hit me as hard as you can.
This isn't such a hard punch. I punch myself, again. It just looks good, all
the blood, but I throw myself back against the wall to make a terrible noise
and break the painting that hangs there.
The broken glass and frame and the painting of flowers and blood go to
the floor with me clowning around. I'm being such a doofus. Blood gets on
the carpet and I reach up and grip monster handprints of blood on the edge
of the hotel manager's desk and say, please, help me, but I start to giggle.
Help me, please.
Please don't hit me, again.
I slip back to the floor and crawl my blood across the carpet. The first
word I'm going to say is please. So I keep my lips shut. The monster drags
itself across the lovely bouquets and garlands of the Oriental carpet. The
blood falls out of my nose and slides down the back of my throat and into
my mouth, hot. The monster crawls across the carpet, hot and picking up
the lint and dust sticking to the blood on its claws. And it crawls close
enough to grab the manager of the Pressman Hotel around his pinstriped
ankle and say it.
money. And I giggle, again.
