In the kitchen are bottles of 80-proof vodka to make the translucent rose
geranium and brown sugar soap and the patchouli soap, and I steal a bottle
of vodka and spend my personal burial money on cigarettes. Marla shows
up. We talk about the plants. Marla and I walk on raked gravel paths
through the kaleidoscope green patterns of the garden, drinking and
smoking. We talk about her breasts. We talk about everything except
Tyler Durden.
And one day it's in the newspaper how a team of men wearing black had
stormed through a better neighborhood and a luxury car dealership
slamming baseball bats against the front bumpers of cars so the air bags
inside would explode in a powdery mess with their car alarms screaming.
At the Paper Street Soap Company, other teams pick the petals from roses
or anemones and lavender and pack the flowers into boxes with a cake of
pure tallow that will absorb their scent for making soap with a flower
smell.
Marla tells me about the plants.
The rose, Marla tells me, is a natural astringent.
Some of the plants have obituary names: Iris, Basil, Rue, Rosemary, and
Verbena. Some, like meadowsweet and cowslips, sweet flag and
spikenard, are like the names of Shakespeare fairies. Deer tongue with its
sweet vanilla smell. Witch hazel, another natural astringent. Orrisroot, the
wild Spanish iris.
Every night, Marla and I walk in the garden until I'm sure that Tyler's not
coming home that night. Right behind us is always a space monkey
trailing us to pick up the twist of balm or rue or mint Marla crushes under
my nose. A dropped cigarette butt. The space monkey rakes the path
behind him to erase our ever being there.
And one night in an uptown square park, another group of men floured
gasoline around every tree and from tree to tree and set a perfect little
forest fire. It was in the newspaper, how townhouse winlows across the
street from the fire melted, and parked cars farted and settled on melted
flat tires.
Tyler's rented house on Paper Street is a living thing wet on the inside
from so many people sweating and breathing. So many people are moving
inside, the house moves.
