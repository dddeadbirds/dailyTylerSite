"In six."
My job, I say. I wish I'd quit my job.
The scream goes by as the car swerves and the mechanic doesn't swerve to
hit it.
More lights are coming at us just ahead, and the mechanic turns to the
three monkeys in the back seat. "Hey, space monkeys," he says, "you see
how the game's played. Fess up now or we're all dead."
A car passes us on the right with a bumper sticker saying, "I Drive Better
When I'm Drunk." The newspaper says thousands of these bumper stickers
just appeared on cars one morning. Other bumper stickers said things like
"Make Mine Veal."
"Drunk Drivers Against Mothers."
"Recycle All the Animals."
Reading the newspaper, I knew the Misinformation Committee had pulled
this. Or the Mischief Committee.
Sitting beside me, our clean and sober fight club mechanic tells me, yeah,
the Drunk bumper stickers are part of Project Mayhem.
The three space monkeys are quiet in the back seat.
The Mischief Committee is printing airline pocket cards that show
passengers fighting each other for oxygen masks while their jetliner
flames down toward the rocks at a thousand miles an hour.
Mischief and Misinformation Committees are racing each other to develop
a computer virus that will make automated bank tellers sick enough to
vomit storms of ten- and twenty-dollar bills.
The cigarette lighter in the dash pops out hot, and the mechanic tells me to
light the candles on the birthday cake.
I light the candles, and the cake shimmers under a little halo of fire.
"What will you wish you'd done before you died?" the mechanic says and
swerves us into the path of a truck coming head-on. The truck hits the air
horn, bellowing one long blast after another as the truck's headlights, like a
sunrise, come brighter and brighter to sparkle off the mechanic's smile.
"Make your wish, quick," he says to the rearview mirror where the three
space monkeys are sitting in the back seat. "We've got five seconds to
oblivion.
"One," he says.
