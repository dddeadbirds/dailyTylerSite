My legs are stretched out straight and together behind me. My pants slip
down my legs and are gone. The sun shines warm on my ass.
Blood pounding in my head, my eyes bugging from the pressure, all I can
see is the white shirt hanging around my face. The tractor rattles
somewhere. The bees buzz. Somewhere. Everything is a million miles
away. Somewhere a million miles behind me someone is yelling, "Two
minutes!"
And a hand slips between my legs and gropes for me.
"Don't hurt him," someone says.
The hands around my ankles are a million miles away. Picture them at the
end of a long, long road. Guided meditation.
Don't picture the windowsill as a dull hot knife slitting open your belly.
Don't picture a team of men tug-of-warring your legs apart.
A million miles away, a bah-zillion miles away, a rough warm hand wraps
around the base of you and pulls you back, and something is holding you
tight, tighter, tighter.
A rubber band.
You're in Ireland.
You're in fight club.
You're at work.
You're anywhere but here.
"Three minutes!"
Somebody far far away yells, "You know the speech Mr. Durden. Don't
fuck with fight club."
The warm hand is cupped under you. The cold tip of the knife. An arm
wraps around your chest. Therapeutic physical contact. Hug time. And the
ether presses your nose and mouth, hard. Then nothing, less than nothing.
Oblivion.
