Chapter 18
YOU WAKE UP at Sky Harbor International.
Set your watch back two hours.
The shuttle takes me to downtown Phoenix and every bar I go into there
are guys with stitches around the rim of an eye socket where a good slam
packed their face meat against its sharp edge. There are guys with
sideways noses, and these guys at the bar see me with the puckered hole in
my cheek and we're an instant family.
Tyler hasn't been home for a while. I do my little job. I go airport to
airport to look at the cars that people died in. The magic of travel. Tiny
life. Tiny soaps. The tiny airline seats.
Everywhere I travel, I ask about Tyler.
In case I find him, the driver's licenses of my twelve human sacrifices are

this Tyler Durden. And they wink. They've never heard the name before.
Sir. I ask about fight club. Is there a fight club around here, tonight? No,
sir. The second rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club. The
punched-out guys at the bar shake their heads. Never heard of it. Sir. But
you might find this fight club of yours in Seattle, sir. You wake up at
Meigs Field and call Marla to see what's happening on Paper Street. Marla
says now all the space monkeys are shaving their heads. Their electric
razor gets hot and now the whole house smells like singed hair. The space
monkeys are using lye to burn off their fingerprints.
You wake up at SeaTac.
Set your watch back two hours.
The shuttle takes you to downtown Seattle, and the first bar you go into,
the bartender is wearing a neck brace that tilts his head back so far he has
to look down his purple smashed eggplant of a nose to grin at you.
