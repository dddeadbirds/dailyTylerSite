I always wear a watch.
"Do you know what time it is?"
I asked, where?
"Right here," Tyler said. "Right now."
It was 4:06 P.m.
After a while, Tyler sat cross-legged in the shadow of the standing logs.
Tyler sat for a few minutes, got up and took a swim, pulled on a T-shirt
and a pair of sweatpants, and started to leave. I had to ask.
I had to know what Tyler was doing while I was asleep.
If I could wake up in a different place, at a different time, could I wake up
as a different person?
I asked if Tyler was an artist.
Tyler shrugged and showed me how the five standing logs were wider at
the base. Tyler showed me the line he'd drawn in the sand, and how he'd
use the line to gauge the shadow cast by each log.
Sometimes, you wake up and have to ask where you are.
What Tyler had created was the shadow of a giant hand. Only now the
fingers were Nosferatu-long and the thumb was too short, but he said how
at exactly four-thirty the hand was perfect. The giant shadow hand was
perfect for one minute, and for one perfect minute Tyler had sat in the
palm of a perfection he'd created himself.
You wake up, and you're nowhere.
One minute was enough, Tyler said, a person had to work hard for it, but a
minute of perfection was worth the effort. A moment was the most you
could ever expect from perfection.
You wake up, and that's enough.
His name was Tyler Durden, and he was a movie projectionist with the
union, and he was a banquet waiter at a hotel, downtown, and he gave me
his phone number.
And this is how we met.
