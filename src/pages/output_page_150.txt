Chapter 25
TYLER'S STANDING THERE, perfectly handsome and an angel in his
everything-blond way. My will to live amazes me.
Me, I'm a bloody tissue sample dried on a bare mattress in my room at the
Paper Street Soap Company.
Everything in my room is gone.
My mirror with a picture of my foot from when I had cancer for ten
minutes. Worse than cancer. The mirror is gone. The closet door is open
and my six white shirts, black pants, underwear, socks, and shoes are
gone. Tyler says, "Get up."
Under and behind and inside everything I took for granted, something
horrible has been growing.
Everything has fallen apart.
The space monkeys are cleared out. Everything is relocated, the
liposuction fat, the bunk beds, the money, especially the money. Only the
garden is left behind, and the rented house.
Tyler says, "The last thing we have to do is your martyrdom thing. Your
big death thing."
Not like death as a sad, downer thing, this was going to be death as a
cheery, empowering thing.
Oh, Tyler, I hurt. Just kill me here.
"Get up."
Kill me, already. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me.
"It has to be big," Tyler says. "Picture this: you on top of the world's tallest
building, the whole building taken over by Project Mayhem. Smoke
rolling out the windows. Desks falling into the crowds on the street. A real
opera of a death, that's what you're going to get."
I say, no. You've used me enough.
"If you don't cooperate, we'll go after Marla."
I say, lead the way.
"Now get the fuck out of bed," Tyler said, "and get your ass into the
fucking car."
So Tyler and I are up on top of the Parker-Morris Building with the gun
stuck in my mouth.
