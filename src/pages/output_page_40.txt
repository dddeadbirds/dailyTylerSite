If I had only wasted a couple of minutes and gone over to watch Marla
die, then none of this would have happened.
Tyler tells me how Marla lives in room 8G, on the top floor of the Regent
Hotel, up eight flights of stairs and down a noisy hallway with canned
television laughter coming through the doors. Every couple seconds an
actress screams or actors die screaming in a rattle of bullets. Tyler gets to
the end of the hallway and even before he knocks a thin, thin, buttermilk
sallow arm slingshots out the door of room 8G, grabs his wrist, and yanks
Tyler inside.
I bury myself in a leader's Digest.
Even as Marla yanks Tyler into her room, Tyler can hear brake squeals
and sirens collecting out in front of the Regent Hotel. On the dresser,
there's a dildo made of the same soft pink plastic as a million Barbie dolls,
and for a moment, Tyler can picture millions of baby dolls and Barbie

Marla looks at Tyler looking at her dildo, and she rolls her eyes and says,
"Don't be afraid. It's not a threat to you."
Marla shoves Tyler back out into the hallway, and she says she's sorry, but
he shouldn't have called the police and that's probably the police

In the hallway, Marla locks the door to 8G and shoves Tyler toward the
stairs. On the stairs, Tyler and Marla flatten against the wall as police and
paramedics charge by with oxygen, asking which door will be 8G.
Marla tells them the door at the end of the hall.
Marla shouts to the police that the girl who lives in 8G used to be a lovely
charming girl, but the girl is a monster bitch monster. The girl is infectious
human waste, and she's confused and afraid to commit to the wrong thing
so she won't commit to anything.
"The girl in 8G has no faith in herself," Marla shouts, "and she's worried
that as she grows older, she'll have fewer and fewer options."
Marla shouts, "Good luck."
The police pile up at the locked door to 8G, and Marla and Tyler hurry
down to the lobby. Behind them, a policeman is yelling at the door:
