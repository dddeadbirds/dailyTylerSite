A guy in fight club works on cars so he's parked at the curb in soma body's
black Corniche, and all I can do is look at it, all black and gold, this huge
cigarette case ready to drive me somewhere. This mechanic guy who gets

It's one scary fuck to see guys like our mechanic at fight club. Skinny
guys, they never go limp. They fight until they're burger. White guys like
skeletons dipped in yellow wax with tattoos, black men like dried meat,
these guys usually hang together, the way you can picture them at
Narcotics Anonymous. They never say, stop. It's like they're all energy,
