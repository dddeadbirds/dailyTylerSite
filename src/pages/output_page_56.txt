women guests, tonight, and she's tired, tired of all the people they call their
friends.
The host can't pick her up because Madam's fallen down behind the toilet
in her white dress and she's waving around half a broken perfume bottle.
Madam says she'll cut his throat, he even tries to touch her.
Tyler says, "Cool."
And Albert stinks. Leslie says, "Albert, honey, you stink."
There's no way you could come out of that bathroom not stinking,
Albert says. Every bottle of perfume is broken on the floor and the toilet is
piled full of the other bottles. They look like ice, Albert says, like at the
fanciest hotel parties where we have to fill the urinals with crushed ice.
The bathroom stinks and the floor is gritty with slivers of ice that won't
melt, and when Albert helps Madam to her feet, her white dress wet with
yellow stains, Madam swings the broken bottle at the host, slips in the
perfume and broken glass, and lands on her palms.
She's crying and bleeding, curled against the toilet. Oh, and it stings, she
says. "Oh, Walter, it stings. It's stinging," Madam says.
The perfume, all those dead whales in the cuts in her hands, it stings.
The host pulls Madam to her feet against him, Madam holding her hands
up as if she were praying but with her hands an inch apart and blood
running down the palms, down the wrists, across a diamond bracelet, and
to her elbows where it drips.
And the host, he says, "It will be alright, Nina."
"My hands, Walter," Madam says.
"It will be alright."
Madam says, "Who would do this to me? Who could hate me this much?"
The host says, to Albert, "Would you call an ambulance?"
That was Tyler's first mission as a service industry terrorist. Guerrilla
waiter. Minimum-wage despoiler. Tyler's been doing this for years, but he
says everything is more fun as a shared activity.
At the end of Albert's story, Tyler smiles and says, "Cool."
Back in the hotel, right now, in the elevator stopped between the kitchen
and the banquet floors, I tell Tyler how I sneezed on the trout in aspic for
the dermatologist convention and three people told me it was too salty and
one person said it was delicious.
