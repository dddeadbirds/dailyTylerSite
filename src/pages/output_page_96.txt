Another night that Tyler didn't come home, someone was drilling bank
machines and pay telephones and then screwing lube fittings into the
drilled holes and using a grease gun to pump the bank machines and pay
telephones full of axle grease or vanilla pudding.
And Tyler was never at home, but after a month a few of the space
monkeys had Tyler's kiss burned into the back of their hand. Then those
space monkeys were gone, too, and new ones were on the front porch to
replace them.
And every day, the teams of men came and went in different cars. You
never saw the same car twice. One evening, I hear Marla on the front
porch, telling a space monkey, "I'm here to see Tyler. Tyler Durden He
lives here. I'm his friend."
The space monkey says, "I'm sorry, but you're too . . . ," and he pauses,
"you're too young to train here."
Marla says, "Get screwed."
"Besides," the space monkey says, "you haven't brought the required
items: two black shirts, two pair of black pants-"
Marla screams, "Tyler!"
"One pair of heavy black shoes."
"Tyler!"
"Two pair of black socks and two pair of plain underwear."
"Tyler!"
And I hear the front door slam shut. Marla doesn't wait the three days.
Most days, after work, I come home and make a peanut butter sandwich.
When I come home, one space monkey is reading to the assembled space
monkeys who sit covering the whole first floor. "You are not a beautiful
and unique snowflake. You are the same decaying organic matter as
everyone else, and we are all part of the same compost pile."
The space monkey continues, "Our culture has made us all the same. No
one is truly white or black or rich, anymore. We all want the same.
Individually, we are nothing."
The reader stops when I walk in to make my sandwich, and all the space
monkeys sit silent as if I were alone. I say, don't bother. I've already read
it. I typed it.
Even my boss has probably read it.
