The circle of men collapses in on top of me, and two hundred hands clamp
around every inch of my arms and legs and I'm lifted spreadeagle toward
the light.
Prepare to evacuate soul in five, in four, three, two, one.
And I'm passed overhead, hand to hand, crowd surfing toward the door.
I'm floating. I'm flying.
I'm yelling, fight club is mine. Project Mayhem was my idea. You can't
throw me out. I'm in control here. Go home.
The voice of the chapter leader yells, "Registered fight number one, please
take the center of the floor. Now!"
I'm not leaving. I'm not giving up. I can beat this. I'm in control here.
"Evict fight club member, now!"
Evacuate soul, now.
And I fly slowly out the door and into the night with the stars overhead
and the cold air, and I settle to the parking lot concrete. All the hands
retreat, and a door shuts behind me, and a bolt snaps it locked. In a
hundred cities, fight club goes on without me.
FOR YEARS NOW I've wanted to fall asleep. The sort of slipping off, the
giving up, the falling part of sleep. Now sleeping is the last thing I want to
do.
I'm with Marla in room 8G at the Reagent Hotel. With all the old people
and junkies shut up in their little rooms, here, somehow, my pacing
desperation seems sort of norms and expected.
"Here," Marla says while she's sitting cross-legged on her bed and
punching a half-dozen wake-up pills out of their plastic blister cart "I used
to date a guy who had terrible nightmares. He hated to sleep too."
What happened to the guy she was dating?
"Oh, he died. Heart attack. Overdose. Way too many amphetamines,"
Marls says. "He was only nineteen."
Thanks for sharing.
When we walked into the hotel, the guy at the lobby desk had half his hair
torn out at the roots. His scalp raw and scabbed, he saluted me. The
seniors watching television in the lobby all turned to see who I was when
the guy at the desk called me sir.
