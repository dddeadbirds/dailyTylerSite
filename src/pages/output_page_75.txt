Before anyone knew any better, a lot of gay guys had wanted children, and
now the children are sick and the mothers are dying and the fathers are
dead, and sitting in the hospital vomit smell of piss and vinegar while a
nurse asks each mother how long she's been sick and how much weight
she's lost and if her child has any living parent or guardian, Marla decides,
no.
If she was going to die, Marla didn't want to know about it.
Marla walked around the corner from the clinic to City Laundry and stole
all the jeans out of the dryers, then walked to a dealer who gave her fifteen
bucks a pair. Then Marla bought herself some really good pantyhose, the
kind that don't run.
"Even the good kind that don't run," Marla says, "they snag."
Nothing is static. Everything is falling apart.
Marla started going to the support groups since it was easier to be around
other human butt wipe. Everyone has something wrong. And for a while,
her heart just sort of flatlined.
Marla started a job doing prepaid funeral plans for a mortuary where
sometimes great fat men, but usually fat women, would come out of the
mortuary showroom carrying a crematory urn the size of an egg cup, and
Marla would sit there at her desk in the foyer with her dark hair tied down
and her snagged pantyhose and breast lump and doom, and say, "Madam,
don't flatter yourself. We couldn't get even your burned-up head into that
tiny thing. Go back and get an urn the size of a bowling ball."
Marla's heart looked the way my face was. The crap and the trash of the
world. Post-consumer human butt wipe that no one would ever go to the
trouble to recycle.
Between the support groups and the clinic, Marla told me, she had met a
lot of people who were dead. These people were dead and on the other
side, and at night they called on the telephone. Marla would go to bars and
hear the bartender calling her name, and when she took the call the line
was dead.
At the time, she thought this was hitting bottom.
"When you're twenty-four," Marla says, "you have no idea how far you
can really fall, but I was a fast learner."
