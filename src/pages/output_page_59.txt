The cars are the beater first cars kids drive in high school: Gremlins and
Pacers, Mavericks and Hornets, Pintos, International Harvester pickup
trucks, lowered Camaros and Dusters and Impalas. Cars that people loved
and then dumped. Animals at the pound. Bridesmaid dresses at the
Goodwill. With dents and gray or red or black primer quarter panels and
rocker panels and lumps of body putty that nobody ever got around to
sanding. Plastic wood and plastic leather and plastic chrome interiors. At
night, the gypsy guys don't even lock the car doors.
The headlights on the boulevard go by behind the price painted on
the Impala-big wraparound Cinemascope windshield. See the U.S.A. The
price is ninety-eight dollars. From the inside, this looks like eightynine
cents. Zero, zero, decimal point, eight, nine. America is asking you to call.
Most of the cars here are about a hundred dollars, and all the cars have an
"AS IS" sales agreement hanging in the driver's window.
We chose the Impala because if we have to sleep in a car on Saturday
night, this car has the biggest seats.
We're eating Chinese because we can't go home. It was either sleep here,
or stay up all night at an after-hours dance club. We don't go to dance
clubs. Tyler says the music is so loud, especially the base tracks, that it
screws with his biorhythm. The last time we went out, Tyler said the loud
music made him constipated. This, and the club is too loud to talk, so after
a couple of drinks, everyone feels like the center of attention but
completely cutoff from participating with anyone else.
You're the corpse in an English murder mystery.
We're sleeping in a car tonight because Marla came to the house and
threatened to call the police and have me arrested for cooking her mother,
and then Marla slammed around the house, screaming that I was a ghoul
and a cannibal and she went kicking through the piles of Reader's Digest
and National Geographic, and then I left her there. In a nutshell.
After her accidental on-purpose suicide with Xanax at the Regent Hotel, I
can't imagine Marla calling the police, but Tyler thought it would be good
to sleep out, tonight. Just in case.
Just in case Marla burns the house down.
Just in case Marla goes out and finds a gun.
Just in case Marla is still in the house.
