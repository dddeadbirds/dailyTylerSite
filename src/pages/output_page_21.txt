Marla's the faker. You're the faker. Everyone around when they wince or
twitch and fall down barking and the crotch of their jeans turns dark blue,
well, it's all just a big act.
Guided meditation all of a sudden won't take me anywhere, tonight.
Behind each of the seven palace doors, the green door, the orange door,
Marla. The blue door, Marla stands there. Liar. In the guided meditation
through the cave of my power animal, my power animal is Marla.
Smoking her cigarette, Marla, rolling her eyes. Liar. Black hair and
pillowy French lips. Faker. Italian dark leather sofa lips. You can't escape.
Chloe was the genuine article.
Chloe was the way Joni Mitchell's skeleton would look if you made it
smile and walk around a party being extra special nice to everyone.
Picture Chloe's popular skeleton the size of an insect, running through the
vaults and galleries of her innards at two in the morning. Her pulse a siren
overhead, announcing: Prepare for death in ten, in nine, in eight seconds.
Death will commence in seven, six . . .
At night, Chloe ran around the maze of her own collapsing veins and burst
tubes spraying hot lymph. Nerves surface as trip wires in the tissue.
Abscesses swell in the tissue around her as hot white pearls.
The overhead announcement, prepare to evacuate bowels in ten, in nine,
eight, seven.
Prepare to evacuate soul in ten, in nine, eight.
Chloe's splashing through the ankle-deep backup of renal fluid from her
failed kidneys.
Death will commence in five.
Five, four.
Four.
Around her, parasitic life spray paints her heart.
Four, three.
Three, two.
Chloe climbs hand-over-hand up the curdled lining of her own throat.
Death to commence in three, in two.
Moonlight shines in through the open mouth.
Prepare for the last breath, now.
Evacuate.
