Deliver me from clever art.
And the phone rang and Tyler answered.
"If you don't know what you want," the doorman said, "you end up with a
lot you don't."
May I never be complete.
May I never be content.
May I never be perfect.
Deliver me, Tyler, from being perfect and complete.
Tyler and I agreed to meet at a bar.
The doorman asked for a number where the police could reach me. It was
still raining. My Audi was still parked in the lot, but a Dakapo halogen
torchiere was speared through the windshield.
Tyler and I, we met and drank a lot of beer, and Tyler said, yes, I could
move in with him, but I would have to do him a favor.
The next day, my suitcase would arrive with the bare minimum, six shirts,
six pair of underwear.
There, drunk in a bar where no one was watching and no one would care, I
asked Tyler what he wanted me to do.
Tyler said, "I want you to hit me as hard as you can."
