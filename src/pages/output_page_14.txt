Switch.
You wake up at SeaTac.
I study the people on the laminated airline seat card. A woman floats in
the ocean, her brown hair spread out behind her, her seat cushion clutched
to her chest. The eyes are wide open, but the woman doesn't smile or
frown. In another picture, people calm as Hindu cows reach up from their
seats toward oxygen masks sprung out of the ceiling.
This must be an emergency.
Oh.
We've lost cabin pressure.
You wake up, and you're at Willow Run.
Old theater, new theater, to ship a movie to the next theater, Tyler has to
break the movie back down to the original six or seven reels. The small
reels pack into a pair of hexagonal steel suitcases. Each suitcase has a
handle on top. Pick one up, and you'll dislocate a shoulder.

the xenon bulbs that if you looked right at them you're blind. The first dot
flashes on the screen. The sound in a movie comes from a big speaker
behind the screen. The projectionist booth is soundproof because inside
