"Two."
The truck is everything in front of us, blinding bright and roaring.
"Three."
"Ride a horse," comes from the back seat.
"Build a house," comes another voice.
"Get a tattoo."
The mechanic says, "Believe in me and you shall die, forever."
Too late, the truck swerves and the mechanic swerves but the rear of our
Corniche fishtails against one end of the truck's front bumper.
Not that I know this at the time, what I know is the lights, the truck
headlights blink out into darkness and I'm thrown first against the
passenger door and then against the birthday cake and the mechanic
behind the steering wheel.
The mechanic's lying crabbed on the wheel to keep it straight and the
birthday candles snuff out. In one perfect second there's no light inside the
warm black leather car and our shouts all hit the same deep note, the same
low moan of the truck's air horn, and we have no control, no choice, no
direction, and no escape and we're dead.
My wish right now is for me to die. I am nothing in the world compared to
Tyler.
I am helpless.
I am stupid, and all I do is want and need things.
My tiny life. My little shit job. My Swedish furniture. I never, no, never
told anyone this, but before I met Tyler, I was planning to buy a dog and
name it "Entourage."
This is how bad your life can get.
Kill me.
I grab the steering wheel and crank us back into traffic.
Now.
Prepare to evacuate soul.
Now.
The mechanic wrestles the wheel toward the ditch, and I wrestle to
fucking die.
Now. The amazing miracle of death, when one second you're walking and
talking, and the next second, you're an object.
