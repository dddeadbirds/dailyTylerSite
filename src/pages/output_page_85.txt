You have to wonder. Was this a committee proposal you could've drawn?
The next Tuesday night, you'll be looking around the Assault Committee
meeting under the one light in the black fight club basement, and you're
still wondering who forced the jag into the fountain.
Who went to the roof of the art museum and snipered paint balls into the
sculpture court reception?
Who painted the blazing demon mask on the Hein Tower?
The night of the Hein Tower assignment, you can picture a team of law
clerks and bookkeepers or messengers sneaking into offices where they
sat, every day. Maybe they were a little drunk even if it's against the rules
in Project Mayhem, and they used passkeys where they could and used
spray canisters of Freon to shatter lock cylinders w > they could dangle,
rappelling against the tower's brick facade, dropping, trusting each other to
hold ropes, swinging, risking quick death in offices where every day they
felt their lives end one hour at a time.
The next morning, these same, clerks and assistant account reps would be
in the crowd with their neatly combed heads thrown back, rummy without
sleep but sober and wearing ties and listening to the crowd around them
wonder, who would do this, and the police shout I ()r everyone to please
get back, now, as water ran down from the broken smoky center of each
huge eye.
Tyler told me in secret that there's never more than four good proposals at
a meeting so your chances of drawing a real proposal and [lot just a blank
are about four in ten. There are twenty-five guys on t Ire Assault
Committee including Tyler. Everybody gets their homework: lose a fight
in public; and each member draws for a proposal.
This week, Tyler told them, "Go out and buy a gun."
Tyler gave one guy the telephone-book yellow pages and told him t () tear
out an advertisement. Then pass the book to the next guy. No two guys
should go to the same place to buy or shoot.
"This," Tyler said, and he took a gun out of his coat pocket, "this is a gun,
and in two weeks, you should each of you have a gun about t Isis size to
bring to meeting.
"Better you should pay for it with cash," Tyler said. "Next meeting, you'll
all trade guns and report the gun you bought as stolen."
