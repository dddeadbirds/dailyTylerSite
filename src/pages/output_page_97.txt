We're all just a big bunch of crap, I say. Go ahead. Play your little game.
Don't mind me.
The space monkeys wait in quiet while I make my sandwich and take
another bottle of vodka and go up the stairs. Behind me I hear, "You are
not a beautiful and unique snowflake."
I am Joe's Broken Heart because Tyler's dumped me. Because my father
dumped me. Oh, I could go on and on.
Some nights, after work, I go to a different fight club in the basement of a
bar or garage, and I ask if anybody's seen Tyler Durden.
In every new fight club, someone I've never met is standing under the one
light in the center of the darkness, surrounded by men, and reading Tyler's
words.
The first rule about fight club is you don't talk about fight club.
When the fights get started, I take the club leader aside and ask if he's seen
Tyler. I live with Tyler, I say, and he hasn't been home for a while.
The guy's eyes get big and he asks, do I really know Tyler Durden?
This happens in most of the new fight clubs. Yes, I say, I'm best buddies
with Tyler. Then, everybody all of a sudden wants to shake my hand.
These new guys stare at the butthole in my cheek and the black skin on my
face, yellow and green around the edges, and they call me sir. No, sir. Not
hardly, sir. Nobody they know's ever met Tyler Durden. Friends of friends
met Tyler Durden, and they founded this chapter of fight club, sir.
Then they wink at me.
Nobody they know has ever seen Tyler Durden.
Sir.
Is it true, everybody asks. Is Tyler Durden building an army? That's the
word. Does Tyler Durden only sleep one hour a night? Rumor has it that
Tyler's on the road starting fight clubs all over the country. What's next,
everybody wants to know.
The meetings for Project Mayhem have moved to bigger basements
because each committee-Arson, Assault, Mischief, and Misinformationgets bigger as more guys graduate out of fight club. Each committee has a
leader, and even the leaders don't know where Tyler's at. Tyler calls them
every week on the phone.
Everybody on Project Mayhem wants to know what's next.
