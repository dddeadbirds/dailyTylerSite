Worker bees can leave
Even drones can fly away
The queen is their slave
You give up all your worldly possessions and your car and go live in a
rented house in the toxic waste part of town where late at night, you can
hear Marla and Tyler in his room, calling each other hum; butt wipe.
Take it, human butt wipe.
Do it, butt wipe.
Choke it down. Keep it down, baby.
Just by contrast, this makes me the calm little center of the world.
Me, with my punched-out eyes and dried blood in big black crusty stains
on my pants, I'm saying HELLO to everybody at work. HELLO! Look at
me. HELLO! I am so ZEN. This is BLOOD. This is NOTHING. Hello.
Everything is nothing, and it's so cool to be ENLIGHTENED. Like me.
Sigh.
Look. Outside the window. A bird.
My boss asked if the blood was my blood.
The bird flies downwind. I'm writing a little haiku in my head.
Without just one nest
A bird can call the world home
Life is your career
I'm counting on my fingers: five, seven, five. The blood, is it mine? Yeah,
I say. Some of it. This is a wrong answer.
Like this is a big deal. I have two pair of black trousers. Six white shirts.
Six pair of underwear. The bare minimum. I go to fight club. These things
happen. "Go home," my boss says. "Get changed."
I'm starting to wonder if Tyler and Marla are the same person. Except for
their humping, every night in Marla's room.
Doing it.
Doing it.
Doing it.
