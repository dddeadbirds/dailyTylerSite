Until my teeth bite through the inside of my cheek.
Until the hole in my cheek meets the corner of my mouth, the two run
together into a ragged leer that opens from under my nose to under my ear.
Number three pounds until his fist is raw.
Until I'm crying.
How everything you ever love will reject you or die.
Everything you ever create will be thrown away.
Everything you're proud of will end up as trash.
I am Ozymandias, king of kings.
One more punch and my teeth click shut on my tongue. Half of my tongue
drops to the floor and gets kicked away.
The little figurine of Mrs. Patrick Madden knelt on the floor next to the
body of her husband, the rich people, the people they called friends,
towering drunk around her and laughing.
The wife, she said, "Patrick?"
The pool of blood spreading wider and wider until it touches her skirt.
She says, "Patrick, that's enough, stop being dead."
The blood climbs the hem of her skirt, capillary action, thread to thread,
climbing her skirt.
Around me the men of Project Mayhem are screaming.
Then Mrs. Patrick Madden is screaming.
And in the basement of the Armory Bar, Tyler Durden slips to the floor in
a warm jumble. Tyler Durden the great, who was perfect for one moment,
and who said that a moment is the most you could ever expect from
perfection.
And the fight goes on and on because I want to be dead. Because only in
death do we have names. Only in death are we no longer part of Project
Mayhem.
