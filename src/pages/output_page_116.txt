The bar is empty, and the bartender says, "Welcome back, sir."
I've never been to this bar, ever, ever before.
I ask if he knows the name Tyler Durden.
The bartender grins with his chin stuck out above the top of the white neck
brace and asks, "Is this a test?"
Yeah, I say, it's a test. Has he ever met Tyler Durden?
"You stopped in last week, Mr. Durden," he says. "Don't you remember?"
Tyler was here.
"You were here, sir."
I've never been in here before tonight.
"If you say so, sir," the bartender says, "but Thursday night, you came in
to ask how soon the police were planning to shut us down."
Last Thursday night, I was awake all night with the insomnia, wondering
was I awake, was I sleeping. I woke up late Friday morning, bone tired
and feeling I hadn't ever had my eyes closed.
"Yes, sir," the bartender says, "Thursday night, you were standing right
where you are now and you were asking me about the police crackdown,
and you were asking me how many guys we had to turn away from the
Wednesday night fight club."
The bartender twists his shoulders and braced neck to look around the
empty bar and says, "There's nobody that's going to hear, Mr. burden, sir.
We had a twenty-seven-count turn-away, last night. The place is always
empty the night after fight club."
Every bar I've walked into this week, everybody's called me sir.
Every bar I go into, the beat-up fight club guys all start to look alike. How
can a stranger know who I am?
"You have a birthmark, Mr. Durden," the bartender says. "On your foot.
It's shaped like a dark red Australia with New Zealand next to it."
Only Marla knows this. Marla and my father. Not even Tyler knows this.
When I go to the beach, I sit with that foot tucked under me.
The cancer I don't have is everywhere, now.
"Everybody in Project Mayhem knows, Mr. Durden." The bartender holds
up his hand, the back of his hand toward me, a kiss burned into the back of
his hand.
My kiss?
