"The second rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club."
I hear Tyler's words come out of my boss, Mister Boss with his midlife
spread and family photo on his desk and his dreams about early retirement
and winters spent at a trailer-park hookup in some Arizona desert. My
boss, with his extra-starched shirts and standing appointment for a haircut
every Tuesday after lunch, he looks at me, and he says:
"I hope this isn't yours."
I am Joe's Blood-Boiling Rage.
Tyler asked me to type up the fight club rules and make him ten copies.
Not nine, not eleven. Tyler says, ten. Still, I have the insomnia, and can't
remember sleeping since three nights ago. This must be the original I
typed. I made ten copies, and forgot the original. The paparazzi flash of
the copy machine in my face. The insomnia distance
of everything, a copy of a copy of a copy. You can't touch anything, and
nothing can touch you.
My boss reads:
"The third rule of fight club is two men per fight."
Neither of us blinks.
My boss reads:
"One fight at a time."
I haven't slept in three days unless I'm sleeping now. My boss shakes the
paper under my nose. What about it, he says. Is this some little game I'm
playing on company time? I'm paid for my full attention, not to waste time
with little war games. And I'm not paid to abuse the copy machines.
What about it? He shakes the paper under my nose. What do I think, he
asks, what should he do with an employee who spends company time in
some little fantasy world. If I was in his shoes, what would I do?
What would I do?
The hole in my cheek, the blue-black swelling around my eyes, and the
swollen red scar of Tyler's kiss on the back of my hand, a copy of a copy
of a copy.
Speculation.
Why does Tyler want ten copies of the fight club rules?
Hindu cow.
