Just in case.
I try to get centered:
Watching white moon face The stars never feel anger Blah, blah, blah, the
end
Here, with the cars going by on the boulevard and a beer in my hand in the
Impala with its cold, hard Bakelite steering wheel maybe three feet in
diameter and the cracked vinyl seat pinching my ass through my jeans,
Tyler says, "One more time. Tell me exactly what happened."
For weeks, I ignored what Tyler had been up to. One time, I went with
Tyler to the Western Union office and watched as he sent Marla's mother a
telegram.
HIDEOUSLY WRINKLED (stop) PLEASE HELP ME! (end)
Tyler had showed the clerk Marla's library card and signed Marla's name
to the telegram order, and yelled, yes, Marla can be a guy's name
sometimes, and the clerk could just mind his own business.
When we were leaving the Western Union, Tyler said if I loved him, I'd
trust him. This wasn't something I needed to know about, Tyler told me
and he took me to Garbonzo's for hummus.
What really scared me wasn't the telegram as much as it was eating out
with Tyler. Never, no, never had Tyler ever paid cash for anything. [,or
clothes, Tyler goes to gyms and hotels and claims clothing out of the lost
and found. This is better than Marla, who goes to Laundromats to steal
jeans out of the dryers and sell them at twelve dollars a pair to those places
that buy used jeans. Tyler never ate in restaurants, and Marla wasn't
wrinkled.
'For no apparent reason, Tyler sent Marla's mother a fifteen-pound box of
chocolates.
Another way this Saturday night could be worse, Tyler tells me in the
Impala, is the brown recluse spider. When it bites you, it injects not just a
venom but a digestive enzyme or acid that dissolves the tissue around the
bite, literally melting your arm or your leg or your face. Tyler was hiding
out tonight when this all started. Marla showed up at the house. Without
even knocking, Marla leans inside the front door and shouts, "Knock,
knock."
