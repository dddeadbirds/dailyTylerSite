"Well," Big Bob says, "I've got good news."
Where is everybody?
"That's the good news," Big Bob says. "The group's disbanded. I only
come down here to tell any guys who might show up."
I collapse with my eyes closed on one of the plaid thrift store couches.
"The good news," Big Bob says, "is there's a new group, but the first rule
about this new group is you aren't supposed to talk about it.
Oh.
Big Bob says, "And the second rule is you're not supposed to talk about
it."
Oh, shit. I open my eyes.
Fuck.
"The group's called fight club," Big Bob says, "and it meets every Friday
night in a closed garage across town. On Thursday nights, there's another
fight club that meets at a garage closer by."
I don't know either of these places.
"The first rule about fight club," Big Bob says, "is you don't talk about
fight club."
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday night, Tyler is a movie projectionist. I
saw his pay stub last week.
"The second rule about fight club," Big Bob says, "is you don't talk about
fight club."
Saturday night, Tyler goes to fight club with me.
"Only two men per fight."
Sunday morning, we come home beat up and sleep all afternoon. "Only
one fight at a time," Big Bob says. Sunday and Monday night, Tyler's
waiting tables. "You fight without shirts or shoes." Tuesday night, Tyler's
at home making soap, wrapping it in tissue paper, shipping it out. The
Paper Street Soap Company. "The fights," Big Bob says, "go on as long as
they have to. Those are the rules invented by the guy who invented fight
club." Big Bob asks, "Do you know him? "I've never seen him, myself,"
Big Bob says, "but the guy's name is Tyler Durden." The Paper Street
Soap Company. Do I know him. I dunno, I say. Maybe.
