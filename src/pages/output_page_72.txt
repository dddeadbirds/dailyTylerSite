left, and there was the sense that he would've left too, he was so
disappointed he never met my eyes as he took the head of my dick and
stretched it toward himself. The canister jetted a tiny spray on what was
left of the wart. The feeling, you could close your eyes and imagine your
dick is a hundred miles long, and it would still hurt.

I said to the medical student, you must not see a lot of birthmarks ;around
here.
It's not that. The student said everyone thought the birthmark was cancer.
There was this new kind of cancer that was getting young men. They wake
up with a red spot on their feet or ankles. The spots don't go away, they
spread until they cover you and then you die.
The student said, the doctors and everyone were so excited because they
thought you had this new cancer. Very few people had it, yet, but it was
spreading.
This was years and years ago.
Cancer will be like that, I tell Marla. There will be mistakes, and maybe
the point is not to forget the rest of yourself if one little part might go bad.
Marla says, "Might."
The student with the nitrogen finished up and told me the wart would drop
off after a few days. On the sticky paper next to my bare ass was a
Polaroid picture of my foot that no one wanted. I said, can I have the
picture?
I still have the picture in my room stuck in the corner of a mirror in the
frame. I comb my hair in the mirror before work every morning and think
how I once had cancer for ten minutes, worse than cancer.
I tell Marla that this Thanksgiving was the first year when my grandfather
and I did not go ice skating even though the ice was almost six inches

forehead or her arms where moles she's had her whole life didn't look
right. They spread out with fringed edges or the moles turned from brown
to blue or black.
When my grandmother got out of the hospital the last time, my
grandfather was carrying her suitcase and it was so heavy he complained
