The mechanic merges the black Corniche onto the old bypass highway
with no passing lane, and already a line of trucks strings together behind
us, going the legal speed limit. The Corniche fills up with the headlights
behind us, and there we are, talking, reflected in the inside of the
windshield. Driving inside the speed limit. As fast as the law allows.
A law is a law, Tyler would say. Driving too fast was the same as setting a
fire was the same as planting a bomb was the same as shooting a man.
A criminal is a criminal is a criminal.
"Last week, we could've filled another four fight clubs," the mechanic
says. "Maybe Big Bob can take over running the next chapter if we find a
bar."
So next week, he'll go through the rules with Big Bob and give him a fight
club of his own.
From now on, when a leader starts fight club, when everyone is standing
around the light in the center of the basement, waiting, the leader should
walk around and around the outside edge of the crowd, in the dark.
I ask, who made up the new rules? Is it Tyler?
The mechanic smiles and says, "You know who makes up the rules."
The new rule is that nobody should be the center of fight club, he says.
Nobody's the center of fight club except the two men fighting. The leader's
voice will yell, walking slowly around the crowd, out in the darkness. The
men in the crowd will stare at other men across the empty center of the
room:
This is how it will be in all the fight clubs.
Finding a bar or a garage to host a new fight club isn't tough; the first bar,
the one where the original fight club still meets, they make their month's
rent in just one fight club Saturday night.
According to the mechanic, another new fight club rule is that fight
club will always be free. It will never cost to get in. The mechanic yells
out the driver's window into the oncoming traffic and the night wind
pouring down the side of the car: "We want you, not your money."
The mechanic yells out the window, "As long as you're at fight club,
you're not how much money you've got in the bank. You're not your job.
You're not your family, and you're not who you tell yourself."
The mechanic yells into the wind, "You're not your name."
