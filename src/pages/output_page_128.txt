I was too complete.
I was too perfect.
I wanted a way out of my tiny life. Single-serving butter and cramped
airline seat role in the world.
Swedish furniture.
Clever art.
I took a vacation. I fell asleep on the beach, and when I woke up there was
Tyler Durden, naked and sweating, gritty with sand, his hair wet and
stringy, hanging in his face.
Tyler was pulling driftwood logs out of the surf and dragging them up the
beach.
What Tyler had created was the shadow of a giant hand, and Tyler was
sitting in the palm of a perfection he'd made himself.
And a moment was the most you could ever expect from perfection.
Maybe I never really woke up on that beach.
Maybe all this started when I peed on the Blarney stone.
When I fall asleep, I don't really sleep.
At other tables in the Planet Denny's, I count one, two, three, four, five
guys with black cheekbones or folded-down noses smiling at me.
"No," Marla says, "you don't sleep."
Tyler Durden is a separate personality I've created, and now he's
threatening to take over my real life.
"Just Eke Tony Perkins' mother in Psycho," Marla says. "This is so cool.
Everybody has their little quirks. One time, I dated a guy who couldn't get
enough body piercings."
My point being, I say, I fall asleep and Tyler is running off with my body
and punched-out face to commit some crime. The next morning, I wake up
bone tired and beat up, and I'm sure I haven't slept at all.
The next night, I'd go to bed earlier.
That next night, Tyler would be in charge a little longer.
Every night that I go to bed earlier and earlier, Tyler will be in charge
longer and longer.
"But you are Tyler," Marla says.
No.
No, I'm not.
