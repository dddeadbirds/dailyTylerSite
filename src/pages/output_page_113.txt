the first thing off the top of your head. Make something up. I don't give a
shit. I have the gun.
Finally, you were listening and coming out of the little tragedy in your
head.
Fill in the blank. What does Raymond Hessel want to be when he grows
up?
Go home, you said you just wanted to go home, please.
No shit, I said. But after that, how did you want to spend your life? If you
could do anything in the world.
Make something up.
You didn't know.
Then you're dead right now, I said. I said, now turn your head.
Death to commence in ten, in nine, in eight.
A vet, you said. You want to be a vet, a veterinarian.
That means animals. You have to go to school for that.
It means too much school, you said.
You could be in school working your ass off, Raymond Hessel, or you
could be dead. You choose. I stuffed your wallet into the back pocket of
your jeans. So you really wanted to be an animal doctor. I took the
saltwater muzzle of the gun off one cheek and pressed it against the other.
Is that what you've always wanted to be, Dr. Raymond K. K. K. K. Hessel,
a veterinarian?
Yeah.
No shit?
No. No, you meant, yeah, no shit. Yeah.
Okay, I said, and I pressed the wet end of the muzzle to the tip of your
chin, and then the tip of your nose, and everywhere I pressed the muzzle,
it left a shining wet ring of your tears.
So, I said, go back to school. If you wake up tomorrow morning, you find
a way to get back into school.
I pressed the wet end of the gun on each cheek, and then on your chin, and
then against your forehead and left the muzzle pressed there. You might as
well be dead right now, I said.
I have your license.
