Chapter 20
FAST FORWARD, fly back home to Marla and the Paper Street Soap
Company.
Everything is still falling apart.
At home, I'm too scared to look in the fridge. Picture dozens of little
plastic sandwich bags labeled with cities like Las Vegas and Chicago and
Milwaukee where Tyler had to make good his threats to protect chapters
of fight club. Inside each bag would be a pair of messy tidbits, frozen
solid. .
In one corner of the kitchen, a space monkey squats on the cracked
linoleum and studies himself in a hand mirror. "I am the all-singing, alldancing crap of this world," the space monkey tells the mirror. "I am the
toxic waste byproduct of God's creation."
Other space monkeys move around in the garden, picking things, killing
things.
With one hand on the freezer door, I take a big breath and try to center my
enlightened spiritual entity.
Raindrops on roses
Happy Disney animals
This makes my parts hurt
The freezer's open an inch when Marla peers over my shoulder and says,
"What's for dinner?"
The space monkey looks at himself squatting in his hand mirror. "I am the
shit and infectious human waste of creation."
Full circle.
About a month ago, I was afraid to let Marla look in the fridge. Now I'm
afraid to look in the fridge myself.
Oh, God. Tyler.
Marla loves me. Marla doesn't know the difference.
"I'm glad you're back," Marla says. "We have to talk."
Oh, yeah, I say. We have to talk.
I can't bring myself to open the freezer.
I am Joe's Shrinking Groin.
