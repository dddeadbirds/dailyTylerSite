between the Boudin of Gravlax arid the Saddle of Venison, the lights
would go out for a minute and someone would fake getting killed. It's
supposed to be a fun let's-pretend sort of death.
The rest of the meal, the guests would get drunk and eat their Madeira
Consomme and try to find clues to who among them was a psychotic
killer.
Marla yells, "You shot the mayor's special envoy on recycling!"
Tyler shot the mayor's special envoy on whatever.
Marla says, "And you don't even have cancer!"
It happens that fast.
Snap your fingers.
Everyone's looking.
I yell, you don't have cancer either!
"He's been coming here for two years," Marla shouts, "and he doesn't have
anything!"
I'm trying to save your life!
"What? Why does my life need saving?"
Because you've been following me. Because you followed me tonight,
because you saw Tyler Durden kill someone, and Tyler will kill anybody
who threatens Project Mayhem.
Everybody in the room looks snapped out of their little tragedies. Their
little cancer thing. Even the people on pain meds look wide-eyed and alert.
I say to the crowd, I'm sorry. I never meant any harm. We should go. We
should talk about this outside.
Everybody goes, "No! Stay! What else?"
I didn't kill anybody, I say. I'm not Tyler Durden. He's the other side of my
split personality. I say, has anybody here seen the movie Sybil?
Marla says, "So who's going to kill me?"
Tyler.
"You?"
Tyler, I say, but I can take care of Tyler. You just have to watch out for
the members of Project Mayhem. Tyler might've given them orders to
follow you or kidnap you or something.
"Why should I believe any of this?"
