Tyler shakes himself off over the soup tureen and says he's run dry.
This is easier with cold soup, vichyssoise, or when the chefs make a really
fresh gazpacho. This is impossible with that onion soup that has a crust of
melted cheese on it in ramekins. If I ever ate here, that's what I'd order.
We were running out of ideas, Tyler and me. Doing stuff to the food sot to
be boring, almost part of the job description. Then I hear one of the
doctors, lawyers, whatever, say how a hepatitis bug can live on stainless
steel for six months. You have to wonder how long this bug can live on
Rum Custard Charlotte Russe.
Or Salmon Timbale.
I asked the doctor where could we get our hands on some of these hepatitis
bugs, and he's drunk enough to laugh.
Everything goes to the medical waste dump, he says.
And he laughs.
Everything.
The medical waste dump sounds like hitting bottom.
One hand on the elevator control, I ask Tyler if he's ready. The scar on the
back of my hand is swollen red and glossy as a pair of lips in the exact
shape of Tyler's kiss.
"One second," Tyler says.
The tomato soup must still be hot because the crooked thing Tyler tucks
back in his pants is boiled pink as a jumbo prawn.
