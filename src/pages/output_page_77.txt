I tell the detective, no, I did not leave the gas on and then leave town. I
loved my life. I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture
That was my whole life. Everything, the lamps, the chairs, the rugs were
me. The dishes in the cabinets were me. The plants were me. The
television was me. It was me that blew up. Couldn't he see that?
The detective said not to leave town.
