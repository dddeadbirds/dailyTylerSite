After hundreds of people were sacrificed and burned, Tyler says, a thick
white discharge crept from the altar, downhill to the river.
First you have to hit bottom.
You're on a platform in a castle in Ireland with bottomless darkness all
around the edge of the platform, and ahead of you, across an arm's length
of darkness, is a rock wall.
"Rain," Tyler says, "fell on the burnt pyre year after year, and year after
year, people were burned, and the rain seeped through the wood ashes to
become a solution of lye, and the lye combined with the melted fat of the
sacrifices, and a thick white discharge of soap crept out from the base of
the altar and crept downhill toward the river."
And the Irish men around you with their little act of rebellion in the
darkness, they walk to the edge of the platform, and stand at the edge of
the bottomless darkness and piss.
And the men say, go ahead, piss your fancy American piss rich and yellow
with too many vitamins. Rich and expensive and thrown away.
"This is the greatest moment of your life," Tyler says, "and you're off
somewhere missing it."
You're in Ireland.
Oh, and you're doing it. Oh, yeah. Yes. And you can smell the ammonia
and the daily allowance of B vitamins.
Where the soap fell into the river, Tyler says, after a thousand years of
killing people and rain, the ancient people found their clothes got cleaner
if they washed at that spot.
I'm pissing on the Blarney stone.
"Geez," Tyler says.
I'm pissing in my black trousers with the dried bloodstains my boss can't
stomach.
You're in a rented house on Paper Street.
"This means something," Tyler says.
"This is a sign," Tyler says. Tyler is full of useful information. Cultures
without soap, Tyler says, they used their urine and the urine of their dogs
to wash their clothes and hair because of the uric acid and ammonia.
There's the smell of vinegar, and the fire on your hand at the end of the
long road goes out.
