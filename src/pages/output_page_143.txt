And she loves you.
She loves Tyler.
She doesn't know the difference.
Somebody has to tell her. Get out. Get out. Get out.
Save yourself. You ride the elevator down to the lobby, and the doorman
who never liked you, now he smiles at you with three teeth knocked out of
his mouth and says, "Good evening, Mr. Durden. Can I get you a cab? Are
you feeling alright? Do you want to use the phone?"
You call Marla at the Regent Hotel.
The clerk at the Regent says, "Right away, Mr. Durden."
Then Marla comes on the line.
The doorman is listening over your shoulder. The clerk at the Regent is
probably listening. You say, Marla, we have to talk.
Marla says, "You can suck shit."
She might be in danger, you say. She deserves to know what's going on.
She has to meet you. You have to talk.
"Where?"
She should go to the first place we ever met. Remember. Think back.
The white healing ball of light. The palace of seven doors.
"Got it," she says. "I can be there in twenty minutes."
Be there.
You hang up, and the doorman says, "I can get you a cab, Mr. burden.
Free of charge to anywhere you want."
The fight club boys are tracking you. No, you say, it's such a nice night, 1
think I'll walk.
It's Saturday night, bowel cancer night in the basement of First Methodist,
and Marla is there when you arrive.
Marla Singer smoking her cigarette. Marla Singer rolling her eyes. Marla
Singer with a black eye.
You sit on the shag carpet at opposite sides of the meditation circle and try
to summon up your power animal while Marla glares at you with her black
eye. You close your eyes and meditate to the palace of the seven doors,
and you can still feel Marla's glare. You cradle your inner child.
Marla glares.
Then it's time to hug.
