"You have a class of young strong men and women, and they want to give
their lives to something. Advertising has these people chasing cars and
clothes they don't need. Generations have been working in jobs they hate,
just so they can buy what they don't really need.
"We don't have a great war in our generation, or a great depression, but we
do, we have a great war of the spirit. We have a great revolution against
the culture. The great depression is our lives. We have a spiritual
depression.
"We have to show these men and women freedom by enslaving them, and
show them courage by frightening them.
"Napoleon bragged that he could train men to sacrifice their lives for a
scrap of ribbon.
"Imagine, when we call a strike and everyone refuses to work until we
redistribute the wealth of the world.
"Imagine hunting elk through the damp canyon forests around the ruins of
Rockefeller Center.
"What you said about your job," the mechanic says, "did you really mean
it?"

"That's why we're on the road, tonight," he says.
We're a hunting party, and we're hunting for fat.
We're going to the medical waste dump.
We're going to the medical waste incinerator, and there among the
discarded surgical drapes and wound dressings, and ten-year-old tumors
and intravenous tubes and discarded needles, scary stuff, really scary stuff,
among the blood samples and amputated tidbits, we'll find more money
than we can haul away in one night, even if we were driving a dump truck.
We'll find enough money to load this Corniche down to the axle stops.
"Fat," the mechanic says, "liposuctioned fat sucked out of the richest
thighs in America. The richest, fattest thighs in the world."
Our goal is the big red bags of liposuctioned fat we'll haul back to Paper
Street and render and mix with lye and rosemary and sell back to the very
people who paid to have it sucked out. At twenty bucks a bar, these are the
only folks who can afford it.
