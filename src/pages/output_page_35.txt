After my last fight, the guy who fought me mopped the floor while I
called my insurance to pre-approve a visit to the emergency room. At the
hospital, Tyler tells them I fell down.
Sometimes, Tyler speaks for me.
I did this to myself.
Outside, the sun was coming up.
You don't talk about fight club because except for five hours from two
until seven on Sunday morning, fight club doesn't exist.
When we invented fight club, Tyler and I, neither of us had ever been in a
fight before. If you've never been in a fight, you wonder. About getting

Shit, I said, that didn't count. I want to try it again.
Tyler said, "Yeah it counted," and hit me, straight on, pox, just like a
cartoon boxing glove on a spring on Saturday morning cartoons, right in
the middle of my chest and I fell back against a car. We both stood there,
