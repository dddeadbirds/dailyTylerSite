Around us, couples stand sobbing, propped against each other.
"You tell on me," Marla says, "and I'll tell on you."
Then we can split the week, I say. Marla can have bone disease, brain
parasites, and tuberculosis. I'll keep testicular cancer, blood parasites, and
organic brain dementia.
Marla says, "What about ascending bowel cancers?"
The girl has done her homework.
We'll split bowel cancer. She gets it the first and third Sunday of every
month.
"No," Marla says. No, she wants it all. The cancers, the parasites. Marla's
eyes narrow. She never dreamed she could feel so 'smarvelous. She
actually felt alive. Her skin was clearing up. All her life, she never saw a
dead person. There was no real sense of life because she had nothing to

Weeping and shuddering, terror and remorse. Now that she knows where
we're all going, Marla feels every moment of her life.
No, she wasn't leaving any group.
"Not and go back to the way life felt before," Marla says. "I used to work
in a funeral home to feel good about myself, just the fact I was breathing.
So what if I couldn't get a job in my field."

Couples around the two of us are drying their tears, sniffing, patting each
other on the back and letting go.
We can't both come, I tell her.
"Then don't come." I need this. "Then go to funerals." Everyone else has
broken apart and they're joining hands for the closing prayer. I let Marla
go. "How long have you been coming here?" The closing prayer. Two
years. A man in the prayer circle takes my hand. A man takes Marla's
hand. These prayers start and usually, my breathing is blown. Oh, bless us.
Oh, bless us in our anger and our fear. "Two years?" Marla tilts her head
to whisper. Oh, bless us and hold us. Anyone who might've noticed me in
two years has either died or recovered and never came back. Help us and
