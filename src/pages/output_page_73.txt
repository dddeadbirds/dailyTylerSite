that he felt lopsided. My French-Canadian grandmother was so modest
that she never wore a swimming suit in public and she al
ways ran water in the sink to mask any sound she might make in the
bathroom. Coming out of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital after a partial
mastectomy, she says: "You feel lopsided?"
For my grandfather, that sums up the whole story, my grandmother,
cancer, their marriage, your life. He laughs every time he tells that story.
Marla isn't laughing. I want to make her laugh, to warm her up. To make
her forgive me for the collagen, I want to tell Marla there's nothing for me
to find. If she found anything this morning, it was a mistake. A birthmark.
Marla has the scar from Tyler's kiss on the back of her hand.
I want to make Marla laugh so I don't tell her about the last time I hugged
Chloe, Chloe without hair, a skeleton dipped in yellow wax with a silk
scarf tied around her bald head. I hugged Chloe one last time before she
disappeared forever. I told her she looked like a pirate, and she laughed.
Me, when I go to the beach, I always sit with my right foot tucked under
me. Australia and New Zealand, or I keep it buried in the sand. My fear is
that people will see my foot and I'll start to die in their minds. The cancer I
don't have is everywhere now. I don't tell Marla that.
There are a lot of things we don't want to know about the people we love.
To warm her up, to make her laugh, I tell Marla about the woman in Dear
Abby who married a handsome successful mortician and on their wedding
night, he made her soak in a tub of ice water until her skin was freezing to
the touch, and then he made her lie in bed completely still while he had
intercourse with her cold inert body.
The funny thing is this woman had done this as a newlywed, and gone on
to do it for the next ten years of marriage and now she was writing to Dear
Abby to ask if Abby thought it meant something.
