As if Tyler here with cigarette burns marching up his arms is such an
evolved soul. Mister and Missus Human Butt Wipe. I calm my face down
and turn into one of those Hindu cow people going to slaughter on the
airline emergency procedure card.
Turn down the heat under the pan.
I stir the boiling water.
More and more tallow will rise until the water is skinned over with a
rainbow mother-of-pearl layer. Use a big spoon to skim the layer off, and
set this layer aside.
So, I say, how is Marla?
Tyler says, "At least Marla's trying to hit bottom."
I stir the boiling water.
Keep skimming until no more tallow rises. This is tallow we're skimming
off the water. Good clean tallow.
Tyler says I'm nowhere near hitting the bottom, yet. And if I don't fall all
the way, I can't be saved. Jesus did it with his crucifixion thing. I shouldn't
just abandon money and property and knowledge. This isn't just a
weekend retreat. I should run from self-improvement, and I should be
running toward disaster. I can't just play it safe anymore.
This isn't a seminar.
"If you lose your nerve before you hit the bottom," Tyler says, "you'll
never really succeed."
Only after disaster can we be resurrected.
"It's only after you've lost everything," Tyler says, "that you're free to do
anything."
What I'm feeling is premature enlightenment.
"And keep stirring," Tyler says.
When the fat's boiled enough that no more tallow rises, throw out the
boiling water. Wash the pot and fill it with clean water.
I ask, am I anywhere near hitting bottom?
"Where you're at, now," Tyler says, "you can't even imagine what the
bottom will be like."
Repeat the process with the skimmed tallow. Boil the tallow in the water.
Skim and keep skimming. "The fat we're using has a lot of salt in it," Tyler
says. "Too much salt and your soap won't get solid." Boil and skim.
