Chapter 23
THE EXPLODED SHELL of my burned-out condo is outer space black
and devastated in the night above the little lights of the city. With the
windows gone, a yellow ribbon of police crime scene tape twists and
swings at the edge of the fifteen-story drop.
I wake up on the concrete subfloor. There was maple flooring once. There
was art on the walls before the explosion. There was Swedish furniture.
Before Tyler.
I'm dressed. I put my hand in my pocket and feel.
I'm whole.
Scared but intact.
Go to the edge of the floor, fifteen stories above the parking lot, and look
at the city lights and the stars, and you're gone.
It's all so beyond us.
Up here, in the miles of night between the stars and the Earth, I feel just
like one of those space animals.
Dogs.
Monkeys.
Men.
You just do your little job. Pull a lever. Push a button. You don't really
understand any of it.
The world is going crazy. My boss is dead. My home is gone. My job is
gone. And I'm responsible for it all.
There's nothing left.
I'm overdrawn at the bank.
Step over the edge.
The police tape flutters between me and oblivion.
Step over the edge.
What else is there?
Step over the edge.
There's Marla.
Jump over the edge.
There's Marla, and she's in the middle of everything and doesn't know it.
