Chapter 12
MISTER HIS HONOR, mister chapter president of the local chapter of the
national united projectionist and independent theater operators union just
sat.
Under and behind and inside everything the man took for granted,
something horrible had been growing.
Nothing is static.
Everything is falling apart.
I know this because Tyler knows this.
For three years Tyler had been doing film buildup and breakdown for a
chain of movie houses. A movie travels in six or seven small reels packed
in a metal case. Tyler's job was to splice the small reels together into
single fivefoot reels that self-threading and rewinding projectors could
handle. After three years, seven theaters, at least three screens per theater,
new shows every week, Tyler had handled hundreds of prints.
Too bad, but with more self-threading and rewinding projectors, the union
didn't need Tyler anymore. Mister chapter president had to call Tyler in
for a little sit-down.
The work was boring and the pay was crap, so the president of the united
union of united projection operators independent and united theaters
united said it was doing Tyler Durden a chapter favor by giving Tyler the
diplomatic shaft.
Don't think of this as rejection. Think of it as downsizing.
Right up the butt mister chapter president himself says, "We appreciate
your contribution to our success."
Oh, that wasn't a problem, Tyler said, and grinned. As long as the union
kept sending a paycheck, he'd keep his mouth shut.
Tyler said, "Think of this as early retirement, with pension."
Tyler had handled hundreds of prints.
Movies had gone back to the distributor. Movies had gone back out in rerelease. Comedy. Drama. Musicals. Romance. Action adventure.
Spliced with Tyler's single-frame flashes of pornography.
Sodomy. Fellatio. Cunnilingus. Bondage.
Tyler had nothing to lose.
