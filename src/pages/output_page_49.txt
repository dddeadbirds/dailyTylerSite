Chapter 7

TYLER'S SALIVA DID two jobs. The wet kiss on the back of my hand
held the flakes of lye while they burned. That was the first job. The second
was lye only burns when you combine it with water. Or saliva.
"This is a chemical burn," Tyler said, "and it will hurt more than you've
ever been burned."
You can use lye to open clogged drains.
Close your eyes.
A paste of lye and water can burn through an aluminum pan.
A solution of lye and water will dissolve a wooden spoon.
Combined with water, lye heats to over two hundred degrees, and as it
heats it burns into the back of my hand, and Tyler places his fingers of one
hand over my fingers, our hands spread on the lap of my bloodstained
pants, and Tyler says to pay attention because this is the greatest moment
of my life.
"Because everything up to now is a story," Tyler says, "and everything
after now is a story."
This is the greatest moment of our life.
The lye clinging in the exact shape of Tyler's kiss is a bonfire or a
branding iron or an atomic pile meltdown on my hand at the end of a long,
long road I picture miles away from me. Tyler tells me to come back and
be with him. My hand is leaving, tiny and on the horizon at the end of the
road.
Picture the fire still burning, except now it's beyond the horizon. A sunset.
"Come back to the pain," Tyler says.
This is the kind of guided meditation they use at support groups.
Don't even think of the word pain.
Guided meditation works for cancer, it can work for this.
"Look at your hand," Tyler says.
Don't look at your hand.
Don't think of the word searing or flesh or tissue or charred.
Don't hear yourself cry.
