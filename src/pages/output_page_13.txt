Chapter 3
YOU WAKE UPat Air Harbor International.
Every takeoff and landing, when the plane banked too much to one side, I
prayed for a crash. That moment cures my insomnia with narcolepsy when
we might die helpless and packed human tobacco in the fuselage.
This is how I met Tyler Durden.
You wake up at O'Hare.
You wake up at LaGuardia.
You wake up at Logan.
Tyler worked part-time as a movie projectionist. Because of his nature,
Tyler could only work night jobs. If a projectionist called in sick, the
union called Tyler.
Some people are night people. Some people are day people. I could only
work a day job.
You wake up at Dulles.
Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip. I prayed for
wind shear effect. I prayed for pelicans sucked into the turbines and loose
bolts and ice on the wings. On takeoff, as the plane pushed down the
runway and the flaps tilted up, with our seats in their full upright position
and our tray tables stowed and all personal carry-on baggage in the
overhead compartment, as the end of the runway ran up to meet us with
our smoking materials extinguished, I prayed for a crash.
You wake up at Love Field.
In a projection booth, Tyler did changeovers if the theater was old enough.
With changeovers, you have two projectors in the booth, and one projector
is running.
I know this because Tyler knows this.
The second projector is set up with the next reel of film. Most movies are
six or seven small reels of film played in a certain order. Newer theaters,
they splice all the reels together into one five-foot reel. This way, you
don't have to run two projectors and do changeovers, switch back and
forth, reel one, switch, reel two on the other projector, switch, reel three on
the first projector.
