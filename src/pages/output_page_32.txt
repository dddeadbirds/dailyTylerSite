Maybe at lunch, the waiter comes to your table and the waiter has the two
black eyes of a giant panda from fight club last weekend when you saw
him get his head pinched between the concrete floor and the knee of a
two-hundred pound stock boy who kept slamming a fist into the bridge of
the waiter's nose again and again in flat hard packing sounds you could

The first fight club was just Tyler and I pounding on each other.
It used to be enough that when I came home angry and knowing that my
