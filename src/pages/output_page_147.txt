Chapter 24
HIS NAME WAS Patrick Madden, and he was the mayor's special envoy
on recycling. His name was Patrick Madden, and he was an enemy of
Project Mayhem.
I walk out into the night around First Methodist, and it's all coming back
to me.
All the things that Tyler knows are all coming back to me.
Patrick Madden was compiling a list of bars where fight clubs met.
All of the sudden, I know how to run a movie projector. I know how to
break locks and how Tyler had rented the house on Paper Street just
before he revealed himself to me at the beach.
I know why Tyler had occurred. Tyler loved Marla. From the first night I
met her, Tyler or some part of me had needed a way to be with Marla.
Not that any of this matters. Not now. But all the details are coming back
to me as I walk through the night to the closest fight club.
There's a fight club in the basement of the Armory Bar on Saturday nights.
You can probably find it on the list Patrick Madden was compiling, poor
dead Patrick Madden.
Tonight, I go to the Armory Bar and the crowds part zipper style when I
walk in. To everybody there, I am Tyler Durden the Great and Powerful.
God and father.
All around me I hear, "Good evening, sir."
"Welcome to fight club, sir."
"Thank you for joining us, sir."
Me, my monster face just starting to heal. The hole in my face smiling
through my cheek. A frown on my real mouth.
Because I'm Tyler Durden, and you can kiss my ass, I register to fight
every guy in the club that night. Fifty fights. One fight at a time. No shoes.
No shirts.
The fights go on as long as they have to.
And if Tyler loves Marla.
I love Marla.
