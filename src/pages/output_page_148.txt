And what happens doesn't happen in words. I want to smother all the
French beaches I'll never see. Imagine stalking elk through the damp
canyon forests around Rockefeller Center.
The first fight I get, the guy gets me in a full nelson and rams my face,
rams my cheek, rams the hole in my cheek into the concrete floor until my
teeth inside snap off and plant their jagged roots into my tongue.
Now I can remember Patrick Madden, dead on the floor, his little figurine
of a wife, just a little girl with a chignon. His wife giggled and tried to
pour champagne between her dead husband's lips.
The wife said the fake blood was too, too red. Mrs. Patrick Madden put
two fingers in the blood pooled next to her husband and then put the
fingers in her mouth.
The teeth planted in my tongue, I taste the blood.
Mrs. Patrick Madden tasted the blood.
I remember being there on the outskirts of the murder mystery party with
the space monkey waiters standing bodyguard around me. Marla in her
dress with a wallpaper pattern of dark roses watched from the other side of
the ballroom.
My second fight, the guy puts a knee between my shoulder blades. The
guy pulls both my arms together behind my back, and slams my chest into
the concrete floor. My collarbone on one side, I hear it snap.
I would do the Elgin Marbles with a sledgehammer and wipe my ass with
the Mona Lisa.
Mrs. Patrick Madden held her two bloody fingers up, the blood climbing
the cracks between her teeth, and the blood ran down her fingers, down
her wrist, across a diamond bracelet, and to her elbow where it dripped.
Fight number three, I wake up and it's time for fight number three. There
are no more names in fight club.
You aren't your name.
You aren't your family.
Number three seems to know what I need and holds my head in the dark
and the smother. There's a sleeper hold that gives you just enough air to
stay awake. Number three holds my head in the crook of his arm, the way
he'd hold a baby or a football, in the crook of his arm, and hammers my
face with the pounding molar of his clenched fist.
