"Yeah, yeah, yeah," the mechanic says. He's halfway down the aisle
holding the knife out in front of him. "You said you would definitely say
that."
Okay so I'm Tyler Durden. I am. I'm Tyler Durden, and I dictate the rules,
and I say, put the knife down.
The mechanic calls back over his shoulder, "What's our best time to date
for a cut-and-run?"
Somebody yells, "Four minutes."
The mechanic yells, "Is somebody timing this?"
Both cops have climbed up into the front of the bus now, and one looks at
his watch and says, "Just a sec. Wait for the second hand to get up to the
twelve."
The cop says, "Nine."
"Eight."
"Seven."
I dive for the open window.
My stomach hits the thin metal windowsill, and behind me, the fight club
mechanic yells, "Mr. Durden! You're going to fuck up the time."
Hanging half out the window, I claw at the black rubber sidewalk of the
rear tire. I grab the wheelwell trim and pull. Someone grabs my feet and
pulls. I'm yelling at the little tractor in the distance, "Hey." And "Hey." My
face swelling hot and full of blood, I'm hanging upside down. I pull myself
out a little. Hands around my ankles pull me back in. My tie flops in my
face. My belt buckle catches on the windowsill. The bees and the flies and
weeds are inches from in front of my face, and I'm yelling, "Hey!"
Hands are hooked in the back of my pants, tugging me in, hugging my
pants and belt down over my ass.
Somebody inside the bus yells, "One minute!"
My shoes slip off my feet.
My belt buckle slips inside the windowsill.
The hands bring my legs together. The windowsill cuts hot from the sun
into my stomach. My white shirt billows and drops down around my head
and shoulders, my hands still gripping the wheelwell trim, me still yelling,
"Hey!"
