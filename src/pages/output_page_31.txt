Chapter 5
TWO SCREENS INTO my demo to Microsoft, I taste blood and have to
start swallowing. My boss doesn't know the material, but he won't let me
run the demo with a black eye and half my face swollen from the stitches
inside my cheek. The stitches have come loose, and I can feel them with
my tongue against the inside of my cheek. Picture snarled fishing line on
the beach. I can picture them as the black stitches on a dog after it's been
fixed, and I keep swallowing blood. My boss is making the presentation
from my script, and I'm running the laptop projector so I'm off to one side
of the room, in the dark.
More of my lips are sticky with blood as I try to lick the blood off, and
when the lights come up, I will turn to consultants Ellen and Walter and
Norbert and Linda from Microsoft and say, thank you for coming, my
mouth shining with blood and blood climbing the cracks between my
teeth.
You can swallow about a pint of blood before you're sick.
Fight club is tomorrow, and I'm not going to miss fight club.
Before the presentation, Walter from Microsoft smiles his steam shovel
jaw like a marketing tool tanned the color of a barbecued potato chip.
Walter with his signet ring shakes my hand, wrapped in his smooth soft
hand and says, "I'd hate to see what happened to the other guy."
The first rule about fight club is you don't talk about fight club.
I tell Walter I fell.
I did this to myself.
Before the presentation, when I sat across from my boss, telling him where
in the script each slide cues and when I wanted to run the video segment,
my boss says, "What do you get yourself into every weekend?"
I just don't want to die without a few scars, I say. It's nothing anymore to
have a beautiful stock body. You see those cars that are completely stock
cherry, right out of a dealer's showroom in 1955, I always think, what a
waste.
The second rule about fight club is you don't talk about fight club.
