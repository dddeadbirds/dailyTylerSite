Chapter 1
TYLER GETS ME a job as a waiter, after that Tyler's pushing a gun in my
mouth and saying, the first step to eternal life is you have to die. For a
long time though, Tyler and I were best friends. People are always asking,
did I know about Tyler Durden.
The barrel of the gun pressed against the back of my throat, Tyler says
"We really won't die."
With my tongue I can feel the silencer holes we drilled into the barrel of
the gun. Most of the noise a gunshot makes is expanding gases, and there's
the tiny sonic boom a bullet makes because it travels so fast. To make a
silencer, you just drill holes in the barrel of the gun, a lot of holes. This
lets the gas escape and slows the bullet to below the speed of sound.
You drill the holes wrong and the gun will blow off your hand.
"This isn't really death," Tyler says. "We'll be legend. We won't grow old."
I tongue the barrel into my cheek and say, Tyler, you're thinking of
vampires.
The building we're standing on won't be here in ten minutes. You take a
98percent concentration of fuming nitric acid and add the acid to three
times that amount of sulfuric acid. Do this in an ice bath. Then add
glycerin drop-by-drop with an eye dropper. You have nitroglycerin.
I know this because Tyler knows this.
