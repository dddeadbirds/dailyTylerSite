This is how it is with insomnia. Everything is so far away, a copy of a
copy of a copy. The insomnia distance of everything, you can't touch
anything and nothing can touch you.
Then there was Bob. The first time I went to testicular cancer, Bob the big
moosie, the big cheesebread moved in on top of me in Remaining Men
Together and started crying. The big moosie treed right across the room
when it was hug time, his arms at his sides, his shoulders rounded. His big
moosie chin on his chest, his eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.
Shuffling his feet, knees together invisible steps, Bob slid across the
basement floor to heave himself on me.
Bob pancaked down on me.
Bob's big arms wrapped around me.
Big Bob was a juicer, he said. All those salad days on Dianabol and then
the racehorse steroid, Wistrol. His own gym, Big Bob owned a gym. He'd
been married three times. He'd done product endorsements, and had I seen
him on television, ever? The whole how-to program about expanding your
chest was practically his invention.
Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one, if you
know what I mean.
Bob didn't know. Maybe only one of his huevos had ever descended, and
he knew this was a risk factor. Bob told me about postoperative hormone
therapy.
A lot of bodybuilders shooting too much testosterone would get what they
called bitch tits.
I had to ask what Bob meant by huevos.
Huevos, Bob said. Gonads. Nuts. Jewels. Testes. Balls. In Mexico, where
you buy your steroids, they call them "eggs."
Divorce, divorce, divorce, Bob said and showed me a wallet photo of
himself huge and naked at first glance, in a posing strap at some contest.
It's a stupid way to live, Bob said, but when you're pumped and shaved on
stage, totally shredded with body fat down to around two percent and the
diuretics leave you cold and hard as concrete to touch, You're blind from
the lights, and deaf from the feedback rush of the sound system until the
judge orders: "Extend your right quad, flex and hold."
"Extend your left arm, flex the bicep and hold."
