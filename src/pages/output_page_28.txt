The Klipsk shelving unit, oh, yeah.
Hemlig hat boxes. Yes.
The street outside my high-rise was sparkling and scattered with all this.
The Mommala quilt-cover set. Design by Tomas Harila and available in
the following:
Orchid.
Fuschia.
Cobalt.
Ebony.
Jet.
Eggshell or heather.
It took my whole life to buy this stuff.
The easy-care textured lacquer of my Kalix occasional tables.
My Steg nesting tables.
You buy furniture. You tell yourself, this is the last sofa I will ever need in
my life. Buy the sofa, then for a couple years you're satisfied that no
matter what goes wrong, at least you've got your sofa issue handled. Then
the right set of dishes. Then the perfect bed. The drapes. The rug.
Then you're trapped in your lovely nest, and the things you used to own,
now they own you.
Until I got home from the airport.
The doorman steps out of the shadows to say, there's been an accident.
The police, they were here and asked a lot of questions.
The police think maybe it was the gas. Maybe the pilot light on the stove
went out or a burner was left on, leaking gas, and the gas rose to the
ceiling, and the gas filled the condo from ceiling to floor in every room.
The condo was seventeen hundred square feet with high ceilings and for
days and days, the gas must've leaked until every room was full. When the
rooms were filled to the floor, the compressor at the base of the
refrigerator clicked on.
Detonation.
The floor-to-ceiling windows in their aluminum frames went out and the
sofas and the lamps and dishes and sheet sets in flames, and the high
school annuals and the diplomas and telephone. Everything blasting out
from the fifteenth floor in a sort of solar flare.
