And the guy stays.
On the third day, another applicant is at the front door. Mister angel is still
there, and Tyler goes down and just tells mister angel, "Come in. Get your
stuff out of the street and come in."
To the new guy, Tyler says, he's sorry but there's been a mistake. The new
guy is too old to train here, and would he please leave.
I go to work every day. I come home, and every day there's one or two
guys waiting on the front porch. These new guys don't make eye contact. I
shut the door and leave them on the porch. This happens every day for a
while, and sometimes the applicants will leave, but most times, the
applicants stick it out until the third day, until most of the seventy-two
bunk beds Tyler and I bought and set up in the basement are full.
One day, Tyler gives me five hundred dollars in cash and tells me to keep
it in my shoe all the time. My personal burial money. This is another old
Buddhist monastery thing.
I come home from work now, and the house is filled with strangers that
Tyler has accepted. All of them working. The whole first floor turns into a
kitchen and a soap factory. The bathroom is never empty. Teams of men
disappear for a few days and come home with red rubber bags of thin,
watery fat.
One night, Tyler comes upstairs to find me hiding in my room and says,
"Don't bother them. They all know what to do. It's part of Project
Mayhem. No one guy understands the whole plan, but each guy is trained
to do one simple task perfectly."
The rule in Project Mayhem is you have to trust Tyler.
Then Tyler's gone.
Teams of Project Mayhem guys render fat all day. I'm not sleeping. All
night I hear other teams mix the lye and cut the bars and bake the bars of
soap on cookie sheets, then wrap each bar in tissue and seal it with the
Paper Street Soap Company label. Everyone except me seems to know
what to do, and Tyler is never home.
I hug the walls, being a mouse trapped in this clockwork of silent men
with the energy of trained monkeys, cooking and working and sleeping in
teams. Pull a lever. Push a button. A team of space monkeys cooks meals
