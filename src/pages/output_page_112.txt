don't step back, and then you let the gun touch you, but even then you
rolled your head up and away from the barrel.
You gave me your wallet like I asked.
Your name was Raymond K. Hessel on your driver's license. You live at
1320 SE Benning, apartment A. That had to be a basement apartment.
They usually give basement apartments letters instead of numbers.
Raymond K. K. K. K. K. K. Hessel, I was talking to you.
Your head rolled up and away from the gun, and you said, yeah. You said,
yes, you lived in a basement.
`You had some pictures in the wallet, too. There was your mother.
This was a tough one for you, you'd have to open your eyes and see the
picture of Mom and Dad smiling and see the gun at the same time, but you
did, and then your eyes closed and you started to cry.
You were going to cool, the amazing miracle of death. One minute, you're
a person, the next minute, you're an object, and Mom and Dad would have
to call old doctor whoever and get your dental records because there
wouldn't be much left of your face, and Mom and Dad, they'd always
expected so much more from you and, no, life wasn't fair, and now it was
come to this.
Fourteen dollars.
This, I said, is this your mom?
Yeah. You were crying, sniffing, crying. You swallowed. Yeah.
You had a library card. You had a video movie rental card. A social
security card. Fourteen dollars cash. I wanted to take the bus pass, but the
mechanic said to only take the driver's license. An expired community
college student card.
You used to study something.
You'd worked up a pretty intense cry at this point so I pressed the gun a
little harder against your cheek, and you started to step back until I said,
don't move or you're dead right here. Now, what did you study?
Where?
In college, I said. You have a student card.
Oh, you didn't know, sob, swallow, sniff, stuff, biology.
Listen, now, you're going to die, Ray-mond K. K. K. Hessel, tonight. You
might die in one second or in one hour, you decide. So lie to me. Tell me
