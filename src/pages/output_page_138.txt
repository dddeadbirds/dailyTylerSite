on the desktop and Tyler on the telephone, telling me, "Go outside. We
have a car."
We have a Cadillac.
The gasoline was still on my hands.
The fight club mechanic asked, what will you wish you'd done before you
died?
I wanted out of my job. I was giving Tyler permission. Be my guest. Kill
my boss.
From my exploded office, I ride the bus to the gravel turnaround point at
the end of the line. This is where the subdivisions peter out to vacant lots
and plowed fields. The driver takes out a sack lunch and a thermos and
watches me in his overhead mirror.
I'm trying to figure where I can go that the cops won't be looking for me.
From the back of the bus, I can see maybe twenty people sitting between
me and the driver. I count the backs of twenty heads.
Twenty shaved heads.
The driver twists around in his seat and calls to me in the back seat, "Mr.
Durden, sir, I really admire what you're doing."
I've never seen him before.
"You have to forgive me for this," the driver says. "The committee says
this is your own idea sir."
The shaved heads turn around one after another. Then one by one they
stand. One's got a rag in his hand, and you can smell the ether. The closest
one has a hunting knife. The one with the knife is the fight club mechanic.
"You're a brave man," the bus driver says, "to make yourself a homework
assignment."
The mechanic tells the bus driver, "Shut up," and "The lookout doesn't say
shit."
You know one of the space monkeys has a rubber band to wrap around
your nuts. They fill up the front of the bus.
The mechanic says, "You know the drill, Mr. Durden. You said it yourself.
You said, if anyone ever tries to shut down the club, even you, then we
have to get him by the nuts."
Gonads.
Jewels.
