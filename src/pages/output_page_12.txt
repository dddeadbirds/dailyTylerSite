The man still crying against her neck, Marla takes another drag on her
cigarette.
I watch her from between Bob's shuddering tits.
To Marla I'm a fake. Since the second night I saw her, I can't sleep. Still, I
was the first fake, unless, maybe all these people are faking with their
lesions and their coughs and tumors, even Big Bob, the big moosie. The
big cheesebread.
Would you just look at his sculpted hair.
Marla smokes and rolls her eyes now.
In this one moment, Marla's lie reflects my lie, and all I can see are lies. In
the middle of all their truth. Everyone clinging and risking to share their
worst fear, that their death is coming head-on and the barrel of a gun is
pressed against the back of their throats. Well, Marla is smoking and
rolling her eyes, and me, I'm buried under a sobbing carpet, and all of a
sudden even death and dying rank right down there with plastic flowers on
video as a non-event.
"Bob," I say, "you're crushing me." I try to whisper, then I don't. "Bob." I
try to keep my voice down, then I'm yelling. "Bob, I have to go to the
can."
A mirror hangs over the sink in the bathroom. If the pattern holds, I'll see
Marla Singer at Above and Beyond, the parasitic brain dysfunction group.
Marla will be there. Of course, Marla will be there, and what I'll do is sit
next to her. And after the introductions and the guided meditation, the
seven doors of the palace, the white healing ball of light, after we open our
chakras, when it comes time to hug, I'll grab the little bitch.
Her arms squeezed tight against her sides, and my lips pressed against her
ear, I'll say, Marla, you big fake, you get out.
This is the one real thing in my life, and you're wrecking it.
You big tourist.
The next time we meet, I'll say, Marla, I can't sleep with you here. I need
this. Get out.
