Chapter 14
MY BOSS BRINGS another sheet of paper to my desk and sets it at my
elbow. I don't even wear a tie anymore. My boss is wearing his blue tie, so
it must be a Thursday. The door to my boss's office is always closed now,
and we haven't traded more than two words any day since he found the
fight club rules in the copy machine and I maybe implied I might gut him
with a shotgun blast. Just me clowning around, again.
Or, I might call the Compliance people at the Department of
Transportation. There's a front seat mounting bracket that never passed
collision testing before it went into production.
If you know where to look, there are bodies buried everywhere.
Morning, I say.
He says, "Morning."
Set at my elbow is another for-my-eyes-only important secret document
One pair of heavy black shoes.
Two pair of black socks and two pair of plain underwear.
One heavy black coat.
This includes the clothes the applicant has on his back.
One white towel.
One army surplus cot mattress.
One white plastic mixing bowl.
At my desk, with my boss still standing there, I pick up the original list
and tell him, thanks. My boss goes into his office, and I set to work
playing solitaire on my computer.
After work, I give Tyler the copies, and days go by. I go to work.
I come home.
I go to work.
I come home, and there's a guy standing on our front porch. The guy's at
the front door with his second black shirt and pants in a brown paper sack
and he's got the last three items, a white towel, an army surplus mattress,
and a plastic bowl, set on the porch railing. From an upstairs window,
Tyler and I peek out at the guy, and Tyler tells me to send the guy away.
"He's too young," Tyler says.
