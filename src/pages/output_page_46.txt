Boil and skim.
Marla is back.
The second Marla opens the screen door, Tyler is gone, vanished, run out
of the room, disappeared.
Tyler's gone upstairs, or Tyler's gone down to the basement.
Poof.
Marla comes in the back door with a canister of lye flakes.
"At the store, they have one-hundred-percent-recycled toilet paper," Marla
says. "The worst job in the whole world must be recycling toilet paper."
I take the canister of lye and put it on the table. I don't say anything.
"Can I stay over, tonight?" Marla says.
I don't answer. I count in my head: five syllables, seven, five.
A tiger can smile
A snake will say it loves you
Lies make us evil
Marla says, "What are you cooking?"
I am Joe's Boiling Point.
I say, go, just go, just get out. Okay? Don't you have a big enough chunk
of my life, yet?
Marla grabs my sleeve and holds me in one place for the second it takes to
kiss my cheek. "Please call me," she says. "Please. We need to talk."
I say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The moment Marla is out the door, Tyler appears back in the room.
Fast as a magic trick. My parents did this magic act for five years.
I boil and skim while Tyler makes room in the fridge. Steam layers the air
and water drips from the kitchen ceiling. The forty-watt bulb hidden in the
back of the fridge, something bright I can't see behind the empty ketchup
bottles and jars of pickle brine or mayonnaise, some tiny light from inside
the fridge edges Tyler's profile bright.
Boil and skim. Boil and skim. Put the skimmed tallow into milk cartons
with the tops opened all the way.
With a chair pulled up to the open fridge, Tyler watches the tallow
