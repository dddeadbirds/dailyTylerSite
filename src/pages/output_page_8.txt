This should be my favorite part, being held and crying with Big Bob
without hope. We all work so hard all the time. This is the only place I
ever really relax and give up.
This is my vacation.
I went to my first support group two years ago, after I'd gone to my doctor
about my insomnia, again.k'
Three weeks and I hadn't slept. Three weeks without sleep, and everything
becomes an out-of-body experience. My doctor said, "Insomnia is just the
symptom of something larger. Find out what's actually wrong. Listen to
your body."
I just wanted to sleep. I wanted little blue Amytal Sodium capsules,
200milligram-sized. I wanted red-and-blue Tuinal bullet capsules, lipstickred Seconals.
My doctor told me to chew valerian root and get more exercise.
Eventually I'd fall asleep.
The bruised, old fruit way my face had collapsed, you would've thought I
was dead.
My doctor said, if I wanted to see real pain, I should swing by First
Eucharist on a Tuesday night. See the brain parasites. See the degenerative
bone diseases. The organic brain dysfunctions. See the cancer patients
getting by.
So I went.
The first group I went to, there were introductions: this is Alice, this is
Brenda, this is Dover. Everyone smiles with that invisible gun to their
head.
I never give my real name at support groups.
The little skeleton of a woman named Chloe with the seat of her pants
hanging down sad and empty, Chloe tells me the worst thing about her
brain parasites was no one would have sex with her. Here she was, so
close to death that her life insurance policy had paid off with seventy-five
thousand bucks, and all Chloe wanted was to get laid for the last time. Not
intimacy, sex.
What does a guy say? What can you say, I mean.
