Freeze.
Drop the weapon.
This was better than real life.
On his hand was a scar from my kiss. From Tyler's kiss. Big Bob's
sculpted hair had been shaved off and his fingerprints had been burned off
with lye. And it was better to get hurt than get arrested, because if you
were arrested, you were off Project Mayhem, no more homework
assignments.
One minute, Robert Paulson was the warm center that the life of the world
crowded around, and the next moment, Robert Paulson was an object.
After the police shot, the amazing miracle of death.
In every fight club, tonight, the chapter leader walks around in the
darkness outside the crowd of men who stare at each other across the
empty center of every fight club basement, and this voice yells:
"His name is Robert Paulson."
And the crowd yells, "His name is Robert Paulson."
The leaders yell, "He is forty-eight years old."
And the crowd yells, "He is forty-eight years old."
He is forty-eight years old, and he was part of fight club.
He is forty-eight years old, and he was part of Project Mayhem.
Only in death will we have our own names since only in death are we no
longer part of the effort. In death we become heroes.
And the crowds yell, "Robert Paulson."
And the crowds yell, "Robert Paulson."
And the crowds yell, "Robert Paulson."
I go to fight club tonight to shut it down. I stand in the one light at the
center of the room, and the club cheers. To everyone here, I'm Tyler
Durden. Smart. Forceful. Gutsy. I hold up my hands for silence, and I
suggest, why don't we all just call it a night. Go home, tonight, and forget
about fight club.
I think fight club has served its purpose, don't you?
Project Mayhem is canceled.
I hear there's a good football game on television . . .
One hundred men just stare at me.
