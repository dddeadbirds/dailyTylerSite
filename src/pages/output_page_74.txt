Chapter 11

THIS IS WHY I loved the support groups so much, if people thought you
were dying, they gave you their full attention.
If this might be the last time they saw you, they really saw you.
Everything else about their checkbook balance and radio songs and messy
hair went out the window.
You had their full attention.
People listened instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
And when they spoke, they weren't telling you a story. When the two of
you talked, you were building something, and afterward you were both
different than before.
Marla had started going to the support groups after she found the first
lump.
The morning after we found her second lump, Marla hopped into the
kitchen with both legs in one leg of her pantyhose and said, "Look, I'm a
mermaid."
Marla said, "This isn't like when guys sit backward on the toilet and
pretend it's a motorcycle. This is a -genuine accident."
Just before Marla and I met at Remaining Men Together, there was the
first lump, and now there was a second lump.
What you have to know is that Marla is still alive. Marla's philosophy of
life, she told me, is that she can die at any moment. The tragedy of her life
is that she doesn't.
When Marla found the first lump, she went to a clinic where slumped
scarecrow mothers sat in plastic chairs on three sides of the waiting room
with limp doll children balled in their laps or lying at their feet. The
children were sunken and dark around their eyes the way or anges or
bananas go bad and collapse, and the mothers scratched at mats of
dandruff from scalp yeast infections out of control. The way the teeth in
the clinic looked huge in everyone's thin face, you saw how teeth are just
shards of bone that come through your skin to grind things up.
This is where you end up if you don't have health insurance.
