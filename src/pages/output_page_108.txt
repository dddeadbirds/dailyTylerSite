Chapter 16
THE FIGHT CLUB mechanic is standing on the gas, raging behind the
wheel in his quiet way, and we still have something important to do,
tonight.
One thing I'll have to learn before the end of civilization is how to look at
the stars and tell where I'm going. Things are quiet as driving a Cadillac
through outer space. We must be off the freeway. The three guys in the
back seat are passed out or asleep.
"You had a near-life experience," the mechanic says.
He takes one hand off the steering wheel and touches the long welt where
my forehead bounced off the steering wheel. My forehead is swelling
enough to shut both my eyes, and he runs a cold fingertip down the length
of the swelling. The Corniche hits a bump and the pain seems to bump out
over my eyes like the shadow from the brim of a cap. Our twisted rear
springs and bumper bark and creak in the quiet around our rush down the
night road.
The mechanic says how the back bumper of the Corniche is hanging by its
ligaments, how it was torn almost free when it caught an end of the truck's
front bumper.
I ask, is tonight part of his homework for Project Mayhem?
"Part of it," he says. "I had to make four human sacrifices, and I have to
pick up a load of fat."
Fat?
"For the soap."
What is Tyler planning?
The mechanic starts talking, and it's pure Tyler Durden.
"I see the strongest and the smartest men who have ever lived," he says,
his face outlined against the stars in the driver's window, "and these men
are pumping gas and waiting tables."
The drop of his forehead, his brow, the slope of his nose, his eyelashes and
the curve of his eyes, the plastic profile of his mouth, talking, these are all
outlined in black against the stars.
"If we could put these men in training camps and finish raising them.
"All a gun does is focus an explosion in one direction.
