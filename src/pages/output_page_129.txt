I love everything about Tyler Durden, his courage and his smarts. His
nerve. Tyler is funny and charming and forceful and independent, and men
look up to him and expect him to change their world. Tyler is capable and
free, and I am not.
I'm not Tyler Durden.
"But you are, Tyler," Marla says.
Tyler and I share the same body, and until now, I didn't know it.
Whenever Tyler was having sex with Marla, I was asleep. Tyler was
walking and talking while I thought I was asleep.
Everyone in fight club and Project Mayhem knew me as Tyler burden.
And if I went to bed earlier every night and I slept later every morning,
eventually I'd be gone altogether.
I'd just go to sleep and never wake up.
Marla says, "Just like the animals at the Animal Control place."
Valley of the Dogs. Where even if they don't kill you, if someone loves
you enough to take you home, they still castrate you.
I would never wake up, and Tyler would take over.
The waiter brings the coffee and clicks his heels and leaves.
I smell my coffee. It smells like coffee.
"So," Marla says, "even if I did believe all this, what do you want from
me?"
So Tyler can't take complete control, I need Marla to keep me awake. All
the time.
Full circle.
The night Tyler saved her life, Marla asked him to keep her awake all
night.
The second I fall asleep, Tyler takes over and something terrible will
happen.
And if I do fall asleep, Marla has to keep track of Tyler. Where he goes.
What he does. So maybe during the day, I can rush around and undo the
damage.
